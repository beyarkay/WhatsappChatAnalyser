05/02/2019, 21:00 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: https://www.news.uct.ac.za/article/-2017-09-21-a-campus-necessity
05/02/2019, 21:01 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: What are your guy's thoughts on this?
05/02/2019, 21:03 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I have an idea for a much simplified reincarnation
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Luc Hayward: Has boyd contacted you with his project idea
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Luc Hayward: ....
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: It's Boyd's idea
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Luc Hayward: So Boyd has an idea😂
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: But a simple interface
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Luc Hayward: RIP Boyd
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Sorry I should've made that clear 😂
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Luc Hayward: 😂
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Luc Hayward: Sneaky
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I assumed he'd already talked to you a lot so you'd already know
05/02/2019, 21:04 - Luc Hayward: anyway
05/02/2019, 21:05 - Luc Hayward: yeah so Boyd had an Idea
05/02/2019, 21:05 - Luc Hayward: no plagiarism please stuart ;)
05/02/2019, 21:05 - Luc Hayward: anyway
05/02/2019, 21:05 - Luc Hayward: I know Charles
05/02/2019, 21:05 - Luc Hayward: I worked with him
05/02/2019, 21:05 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: So when I said "I have an idea" I meant I had an idea re this project
05/02/2019, 21:06 - Luc Hayward: I'm messing with you😂
05/02/2019, 21:06 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Nah I run a clean show 😄
05/02/2019, 21:06 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: No black marks against my name 😆
05/02/2019, 21:06 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ek weet 😂
05/02/2019, 21:07 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Sorry Boyd, in hindsight this looks really rude 😂
05/02/2019, 21:08 - Luc Hayward: 😂😂 OK so shoot
05/02/2019, 21:09 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok let me draw it
05/02/2019, 21:09 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
05/02/2019, 21:23 - Luc Hayward: chat
05/02/2019, 21:24 - Luc Hayward: Boyd and I are friends but not that close
05/02/2019, 21:24 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh _that's_ what you meant
05/02/2019, 21:24 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: My goodness drawing was difficult
05/02/2019, 21:24 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: 😂
05/02/2019, 21:24 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok so my idea was
05/02/2019, 21:25 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: So those electronic train station/airport boards we all know and love?
05/02/2019, 21:26 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: <Media omitted>
05/02/2019, 21:26 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Live updated
05/02/2019, 21:27 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Huh, huuuuh... 😏
05/02/2019, 21:28 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Tell me what you guys think. I'm ready to get roasted if that's the truth 😂
05/02/2019, 21:29 - Luc Hayward: What did you draw this in
05/02/2019, 21:29 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: MS word * takes a bow *
05/02/2019, 21:29 - Luc Hayward: so you know this exists right?
05/02/2019, 21:29 - Luc Hayward: Just not online as far as I know
05/02/2019, 21:29 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Exactly
05/02/2019, 21:29 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Not live updated
05/02/2019, 21:30 - Luc Hayward: So you want to just put it online?
05/02/2019, 21:30 - Luc Hayward: Well the boards by the food court and other areas are aren't they?
05/02/2019, 21:30 - Luc Hayward: Cool
05/02/2019, 21:30 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Well that's the thing. We have to get our Jammy tracking system up and running and feed our predictions into it.
05/02/2019, 21:32 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: So we're basically having to technically achieve most of what those other guys did but instead of the fancy please-download-me app + user accounts etc. the users just hit this webpage and they see everything they really care about when they're on their way to the jammie stop, right?
05/02/2019, 21:35 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah, apart from our real-time predictions I think this is actually a lot easier to read and access the official schedule. Also html5 we can request their location (if they allow once it becomes a saved automatic preference I think) and show the stop they're closest to straight away.
05/02/2019, 21:36 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: *than the official...
05/02/2019, 21:41 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Also I know Boyd has a much more ambitious project in mind. I think the train-station board is a pretty good MVP though. It also doesn't prevent us from carrying on once we've got it running and eventually do Boyd's whole idea. This is basically just a very simple interface but the backend is the same as what we would do with Boyd's.
05/02/2019, 21:47 - Luc Hayward: es
05/02/2019, 21:47 - Luc Hayward: In theory the system should be extensible to any data
05/02/2019, 21:47 - Luc Hayward: Exactly
05/02/2019, 21:47 - Luc Hayward: Yep exactly
05/02/2019, 21:48 - Luc Hayward: Yeah true.
05/02/2019, 21:48 - Luc Hayward: Yeah we must just make sure that it's layed out nicely
05/02/2019, 21:48 - Luc Hayward: All on ratchet studios github page?
05/02/2019, 21:52 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah sounds good 👌🏻
05/02/2019, 22:04 - Luc Hayward: Name for Repo?
05/02/2019, 22:07 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: That's a scary question
05/02/2019, 22:08 - Luc Hayward: It can be renamed
05/02/2019, 22:08 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh cool
05/02/2019, 22:09 - Luc Hayward: soooo
05/02/2019, 22:10 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: https://satellitehigh.bandcamp.com/track/the-bus-is-late
05/02/2019, 22:23 - Boyd Kane: Shoh
05/02/2019, 22:23 - Luc Hayward: Done
05/02/2019, 22:26 - Luc Hayward: Has to be public cause it's made under Ratchet studio's instead of one of our private accounts
05/02/2019, 22:27 - Boyd Kane: Good chat guys👍🏼 do you all want to meet tomorrow afternoon to get some details down irl?
05/02/2019, 22:38 - Luc Hayward: You can view this as essential required reading before contributing to any repos anytime in order of usefulness and importance 😂 Number 2 maybe easier if you want your hand held more :)

05/02/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: Please
05/02/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: For the love of god
05/02/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: Don't commit directly to master unless it is the most asine of changes once things actually start
05/02/2019, 22:41 - Luc Hayward: Actually number 2 is perhaps more quickstart and a better place to start
05/02/2019, 22:43 - Luc Hayward: And yes I know I just repeatedly committed to master xD but nobody is devving yet
05/02/2019, 22:46 - Luc Hayward: 💙
05/02/2019, 22:51 - Boyd Kane: Nah I definitely need this Luc👌🏼💙
05/02/2019, 22:52 - Luc Hayward: 😂 I still have this stuff saved on my pc just to be able to check it
05/02/2019, 22:52 - Luc Hayward: Git is a beast that I'm not even close to defeating
05/02/2019, 22:59 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah, imma go running with Danny Bodi at 6:30 in Newlands though so it'll have to be before that
05/02/2019, 23:00 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I also want to get a parking disc so if we're at UCT please can we make it a time when the parking fines office is open 🙏🏻
05/02/2019, 23:00 - Luc Hayward: You can't
05/02/2019, 23:00 - Luc Hayward: read your emails bru
05/02/2019, 23:00 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: What?
05/02/2019, 23:00 - Luc Hayward: Parking discs remain valid until further notice
05/02/2019, 23:00 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh awesome thanks
05/02/2019, 23:01 - Luc Hayward: They aren't ready to sell this year's discs and new staff/students are getting temp discs
05/02/2019, 23:01 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: That's fantastic
05/02/2019, 23:01 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok then any time before 6:30 works for me 👍🏻
05/02/2019, 23:02 - Luc Hayward: Staff and students are advised that the 2018 parking discs remain valid until further notice. The Traffic Office will advise at a later stage when the 2019 discs are ready to be issued. New staff and eligible new students are being issued with temporary discs.
05/02/2019, 23:02 - Boyd Kane: I have some errands to run at UCT, so I'll probably finish those around 1500
05/02/2019, 23:03 - Boyd Kane: Maybe 1400 at a push
05/02/2019, 23:03 - Luc Hayward: ? What do you have that takes so long this week xD
05/02/2019, 23:03 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Naas 15:00 is against the traffic for us so we love it
05/02/2019, 23:03 - Boyd Kane: Meeting up with some first years @ the creamery
05/02/2019, 23:04 - Luc Hayward: Oh fun
05/02/2019, 23:04 - Luc Hayward: 😂
05/02/2019, 23:04 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Heckers
05/02/2019, 23:04 - Boyd Kane: 🍨🍧🍡🍦
05/02/2019, 23:04 - Boyd Kane: #representation

05/02/2019, 23:05 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: You're already getting the hang of UCT 👌🏻
05/02/2019, 23:05 - Luc Hayward: 😂
05/02/2019, 23:06 - +33 6 45 96 26 98 changed this group's icon
05/02/2019, 23:06 - Luc Hayward changed the subject from "Code" to "The Bus is Late"
05/02/2019, 23:06 - Boyd Kane: Lovely, so 1500 at upper campus somewhere?
05/02/2019, 23:07 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Splendid
05/02/2019, 23:09 - Luc Hayward: I mean sure
05/02/2019, 23:10 - Luc Hayward: I want to learn front end web dev but I'm also busy learning C++ (and refreshing my knowledge on C#)
05/02/2019, 23:11 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: We're gonna make a great team
05/02/2019, 23:11 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I don't want to front end web dev 😂
05/02/2019, 23:12 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: But we can discuss more tomorrow I guess
05/02/2019, 23:15 - Luc Hayward: Also if we're just using one of our UCT accounts to host the website, it only supports HTML and PHP5 (and client side things like Javascript). It also says that it should only be used for CS projects and not for things not relating to your degree or promoting a business so.....technically we're all good?
05/02/2019, 23:16 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I think it's best we discuss this stuff tomorrow but I think this depends on whether we expect to make money out of this
05/02/2019, 23:16 - Boyd Kane: Yeah, I'm off to bed👌🏼
05/02/2019, 23:17 - Luc Hayward: I dont
05/02/2019, 23:17 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Me neither 😂
05/02/2019, 23:17 - Luc Hayward: Well, in the sense that it's good for interviewing topics.
05/02/2019, 23:18 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: But UCT gives us a whole Linux instance! We're not limited to anything! The world is our oyster! 🌅
05/02/2019, 23:18 - Luc Hayward: Nope
05/02/2019, 23:18 - Luc Hayward: Your linux instance is only online while you
05/02/2019, 23:18 - Luc Hayward: while you actually force it to stay open
05/02/2019, 23:18 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Naaah surely not
05/02/2019, 23:18 - Luc Hayward: So you have to be logged in or maintaining a shell session via ssh
05/02/2019, 23:20 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: No you just open a tmux session, start your code, detach from the tmux session and then you can close your ssh session and carry on with your life. When you ssh in the following week you should be able to re-attach to your tmux session as if you never left
05/02/2019, 23:20 - Luc Hayward: You'll see if you go into the honours lab sometimes, people will sticky note over screens with notes to not touch because they have simulations running
05/02/2019, 23:20 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I'll try leave some code running overnight and see if they kill my tmux sesh
05/02/2019, 23:20 - Luc Hayward: As far as I know you'll get timed out by the server
05/02/2019, 23:22 - Luc Hayward: I think when I was in there getting my research data from them they said if you have really long running things you need to warn the sys admin so that it doesn't kill your thread
05/02/2019, 23:23 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh 😂
05/02/2019, 23:23 - Luc Hayward: But maybe if you don't have a high load runnning?
05/02/2019, 23:23 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Well they'd probably be chilled with our project so we can just ask them to let us run stuff
05/02/2019, 23:25 - Luc Hayward: But yeah also like don't know how that would work
05/02/2019, 23:26 - Luc Hayward: Cause really only your public_html directory is open to the internet I think so maybe if you devved in there it would work?
05/02/2019, 23:27 - Luc Hayward: I mean if necessary just leave a server running it's doable for like $5/month I think or less
05/02/2019, 23:27 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah
05/02/2019, 23:38 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: This will probably be the easiest option even if it means we have to pay $5 per month between us
05/02/2019, 23:39 - Luc Hayward: Super cheap and probably helpful
05/02/2019, 23:39 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: The other option is to try convince whoever the admin at UCT is to unblock firewall ports ect for us
05/02/2019, 23:40 - Luc Hayward: Also I'm fairly certain (if I understand it all correctly) most things will let you point multiple domains to a single server instance ? Or do they usually only open one port for you. Stu, you would know this?
05/02/2019, 23:40 - Luc Hayward: It's either Stephaan or that other guy (greg?)
05/02/2019, 23:42 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: 😂 yeah no they can 100% just have a specific url that goes to some port on our users only it's just a matter of whether they're feeling energetic or lazy
05/02/2019, 23:42 - Luc Hayward: ???
05/02/2019, 23:42 - Luc Hayward: Try that again stu haha
05/02/2019, 23:42 - Luc Hayward: oh no I don't mean for direct connections via IP
05/02/2019, 23:43 - Luc Hayward: I mean if you had domain names for things
05/02/2019, 23:43 - Luc Hayward: It's the same concept really though
05/02/2019, 23:43 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah
05/02/2019, 23:43 - Luc Hayward: So it's essentially an arbitrary amount of connections you can register to your server?
05/02/2019, 23:44 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Not 100% sure how it works
05/02/2019, 23:45 - Luc Hayward: same xD
05/02/2019, 23:46 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: https://www.scaleway.com I see these guys offer a fully-fledged instance for 2 eur (currently R30) per month so I guess it's not a huge deal if we have to pay for our own
05/02/2019, 23:46 - Luc Hayward: yeah not a huge deal at all
05/02/2019, 23:48 - Luc Hayward: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA

06/02/2019, 14:24 - Luc Hayward: Sure
06/02/2019, 14:25 - Luc Hayward: Stu I'm running a little late will you fetch Boyd if he needs haha
06/02/2019, 14:32 - Boyd Kane: @27722193705 If you can pick me up that would be amazing
06/02/2019, 14:32 - Boyd Kane: location: https://maps.google.com/?q=-33.9511035,18.4694756
06/02/2019, 14:32 - Boyd Kane: Otherwise the jammies are my best friend
06/02/2019, 14:36 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: If only you knew what time the Jammies would arrive 🤔
06/02/2019, 14:36 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I'm also running a bit late soz, I'll message when I'm leaving 😂
06/02/2019, 14:36 - Boyd Kane: Someone should make an app for that
06/02/2019, 14:36 - Boyd Kane: No worries
06/02/2019, 14:39 - Luc Hayward: I'm fetch you
06/02/2019, 14:39 - Luc Hayward: From creamery?
06/02/2019, 14:40 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: No Cecil road
06/02/2019, 14:40 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Basically drive to Kopano
06/02/2019, 14:41 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Here he is
06/02/2019, 14:43 - Luc Hayward: She
06/02/2019, 14:43 - Luc Hayward: Sure
06/02/2019, 14:43 - Luc Hayward: 20 min
06/02/2019, 14:44 - Boyd Kane: Cheers Luc👌🏼
06/02/2019, 14:51 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Soz I'm v late so you guys can talk behind my back for a while as punishment
06/02/2019, 14:53 - Luc Hayward: Shall do
06/02/2019, 15:02 - Luc Hayward: Here
06/02/2019, 15:02 - Boyd Kane: 👌🏼
06/02/2019, 15:08 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Leaving now
06/02/2019, 15:17 - Luc Hayward: Lots
06/02/2019, 15:19 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ugh I'm stuck in traffic what's going on
06/02/2019, 15:24 - Luc Hayward: Go up to the honours lab
06/02/2019, 15:24 - Luc Hayward: Ours is closed
06/02/2019, 15:28 - Luc Hayward: Actually
06/02/2019, 15:28 - Luc Hayward: Go to CS302

06/02/2019, 22:43 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Hey guys, thanks for today. Good sesh 👌🏻. Really made me want to join you in the academic year.
06/02/2019, 22:44 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I just realised that I was being dumb trying to setup a mysql database. We could literally just save to a sqlite db or even just append to a csv file and have a download link to the csv/sqlite file for convenience. Much simpler.
06/02/2019, 22:50 - Luc Hayward: lol gg

06/02/2019, 23:05 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I mean it's understandable. That's what I would do.
06/02/2019, 23:06 - Luc Hayward: It's alsoi not something you or I have to deal with because we used outlook
06/02/2019, 23:06 - Boyd Kane: The outlook app?
06/02/2019, 23:06 - Luc Hayward: ye
06/02/2019, 23:06 - Luc Hayward: just for the uct email
06/02/2019, 23:07 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I seem to remember having to agree to some similarly dodgy permissions at some point. Not sure if that was at Bishops though.
06/02/2019, 23:08 - Boyd Kane: but ewwwwww
06/02/2019, 23:09 - Boyd Kane: What are the odds of me getting the permissions changed?
06/02/2019, 23:09 - Luc Hayward: I definitely didnt
06/02/2019, 23:09 - Luc Hayward: and the odds are exactly 0
06/02/2019, 23:10 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh yeah you setup your new phone like 3 months ago
06/02/2019, 23:10 - Boyd Kane: Well goodbye push notifications then😒
06/02/2019, 23:10 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Maybe outlook app doesn't require it
06/02/2019, 23:10 - Luc Hayward: Guys
06/02/2019, 23:10 - Luc Hayward: There's no need if you have outlook haha
06/02/2019, 23:11 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah Luc and I are such normies, we just use the outlook app
06/02/2019, 23:12 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Boyd doesn't like the inefficiency of having two email apps, I'm guessing 😂
06/02/2019, 23:21 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ignore this message if you don't care:
curl -d "lat=56&lng=45" -X POST https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~mshstu001/gps_update.php
06/02/2019, 23:21 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: So you don't have to install postman ^^ 🙃
06/02/2019, 23:22 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Or just this if you want to see the rejection message:
curl https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~mshstu001/gps_update.php
06/02/2019, 23:30 - Luc Hayward: Or just postman
06/02/2019, 23:51 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Whatever floats ya boat 🛶

07/02/2019, 17:41 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah
07/02/2019, 18:58 - Boyd Kane: Wrecked
07/02/2019, 18:59 - Boyd Kane: Interesting that they had to go to businesses for money, and couldn't get any other profit models going
07/02/2019, 19:05 - Luc Hayward: I suppose you're looking for people who largely don't have disposable income and/or are not from America and Europe (where Google maps is more than enough and can do trains and busses and all). So there's only really ads
07/02/2019, 22:37 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Even though these guys ripped off Boyd's idea, I'm still keen to build our own just for the experience 👌🏻🤷🏻‍♂
08/02/2019, 14:35 - Luc Hayward: Hey Luc. I'm not personally involved with project anymore, but my friend is. You can contact him via whatsapp, his name is Takunda Chirema and his number is 062 572 0767
08/02/2019, 14:44 - Boyd Kane: I'll not sure actually. I'd rather come up with a unique idea before committing my time to it
08/02/2019, 15:23 - Luc Hayward: Have either of you taken a look at those yt channels?
11/02/2019, 15:39 - +33 6 45 96 26 98 changed the subject from "The Bus is Late" to "Coders gonna code"
11/02/2019, 15:39 - Boyd Kane: *Inverted Lectures*

This year, we're experimenting with inverted lectures: most material is covered in video lectures recorded in 2012 (already watched by over 100,000 people), which you can conveniently play at faster speed than real time. In-class time will be divided between answers to questions, new material presented by the professor and/or guest lecturers, and in-class problem solving, with a focus on problem solving.
11/02/2019, 15:39 - Boyd Kane: What MIT is up to
11/02/2019, 15:48 - Luc Hayward: cool
11/02/2019, 15:48 - Luc Hayward: we had that

11/02/2019, 17:37 - Luc Hayward: What from who>>?>
11/02/2019, 17:38 - Boyd Kane: Some Amazon guys came through and had a couple extra when I went to chat to them
11/02/2019, 17:38 - Luc Hayward: What were they speaking to you about?
11/02/2019, 17:41 - Boyd Kane: Apparently they've got a paper coming out on an efficient TSP. Basically they're just trying to hype up the people and get them all to summon Cthulu with the silicon of a million hello works programs
11/02/2019, 17:42 - Luc Hayward: TSP?
11/02/2019, 17:42 - Luc Hayward: Stu wherre was our hype talk
11/02/2019, 17:44 - Boyd Kane: 💩 travelling💩 salesman💩 problem💩
11/02/2019, 17:44 - Luc Hayward: Ah ok
11/02/2019, 17:44 - Boyd Kane: (I've got no super cool hoodie)
11/02/2019, 17:44 - Luc Hayward: you don't have a hoodie?
11/02/2019, 17:56 - Boyd Kane: Nah I'm pulling a bad joke
11/02/2019, 18:01 - Luc Hayward: Oh....ok I did not get that at the start I thought you were serious 😂
11/02/2019, 18:35 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: That took me a while 😂
11/02/2019, 20:25 - Luc Hayward: Did you actually realise...
11/02/2019, 20:27 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I read the explanation a few times 😶
11/02/2019, 20:30 - Luc Hayward: I still don't see how I was meant to recognise the joke 😂

15/02/2019, 11:23 - Boyd Kane: You know this is probably entirely accurate😂
15/02/2019, 13:25 - Luc Hayward: Have seen even better examples but cool
16/02/2019, 09:54 - Luc Hayward: so Google (well deep mind) say they won't release this because it would be too easy to use in a malicious way

Probably the best examples I've seen
18/02/2019, 07:22 - Boyd Kane: Isn't it the same as Stu's?
18/02/2019, 07:23 - Luc Hayward: Same link, just meant these particular face examples
18/02/2019, 07:23 - Luc Hayward: As in the fewest errors
18/02/2019, 07:24 - Luc Hayward: Oh nvm
18/02/2019, 07:24 - Luc Hayward: There's just as many of you open them fully
18/02/2019, 07:24 - Luc Hayward: Weird that it always seems to chunk out the top of the head in the middle
18/02/2019, 07:56 - Boyd Kane: I feel this is one ~small step~ team of Turks from automatic meme generation
18/02/2019, 07:58 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh yeah the ~interns~ team of Turks will have to get busy
18/02/2019, 07:59 - Boyd Kane: Interns: _furiously labelling engine pixels_

18/02/2019, 08:48 - Luc Hayward: Nice!
18/02/2019, 09:31 - Luc Hayward: yeah so stuart didnt know that "tier is pronounced "teer" and not "tire"
18/02/2019, 09:34 - Boyd Kane: Just making a jab at Stuart's intern leaders getting the lot of them to label engines for 2 weeks🤷🏼‍♂
18/02/2019, 09:34 - Luc Hayward: 🤷‍♂
18/02/2019, 09:34 - Boyd Kane: 🤷🏻‍♂
18/02/2019, 09:35 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: What Boyd said

@27673227353  how is this not something we thought to exolore
05/03/2019, 14:48 - Boyd Kane: Some Americans tried to do a similar thing I think, but it was illegal to sub-lease a parking bay that was owned by your landlord/the city
05/03/2019, 14:49 - Boyd Kane: So brilliant idea, but you need a really high adoption in order for it to work
05/03/2019, 15:05 - Luc Hayward: Oh lol ok 😂
05/03/2019, 15:22 - Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/98V6PnwVXCc

07/03/2019, 18:37 - Luc Hayward: Is alfred really so good to download
07/03/2019, 20:14 - Boyd Kane: <Media omitted>
07/03/2019, 20:18 - Boyd Kane: Hundred percent. Just get the free version, have a look into the basics and then see if you like it. Fair warning though, it's like any keyboard shortcuts, you have to put in the effort to remember the basics so that they can become muscle memory

13/03/2019, 21:13 - Boyd Kane: Yeah it's really not enjoying the voice note. I'll keep trying

13/03/2019, 21:25 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: That's a video of it
13/03/2019, 21:27 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: This guy has a video of his with a pretentious tower of textbooks behind it to scare us away 😂
13/03/2019, 21:31 - Luc Hayward: Must I watch ?
13/03/2019, 21:31 - Boyd Kane: It's an impressive display
13/03/2019, 21:32 - Luc Hayward: That's long af but very cool. Seems complex as shit
13/03/2019, 22:44 - Boyd Kane: I was actually talking about the video from Stu's GitHub link🙈:
13/03/2019, 22:45 - Boyd Kane: http://youtu.be/4yRuhoLrG7s
14/03/2019, 19:04 - Luc Hayward: Only issue around having the camera seeing the bottom is that we interact with the cube from the top?
14/03/2019, 19:04 - Luc Hayward: Unless I'm missing something
15/03/2019, 10:33 - Boyd Kane: Are you guys free?
15/03/2019, 10:34 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Not today sorry
15/03/2019, 10:36 - Boyd Kane: 😂it's awake
15/03/2019, 10:37 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: It is... 😅

15/03/2019, 10:40 - Luc Hayward: Oh
15/03/2019, 10:40 - Luc Hayward: Stuart is it
15/03/2019, 10:40 - Luc Hayward: I am
15/03/2019, 10:40 - Luc Hayward: My lunch got moved so actually am free today 😂
15/03/2019, 10:44 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Who moves your lunch?
15/03/2019, 10:45 - Luc Hayward: Moved it to yesterday
15/03/2019, 10:45 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Shame today's gonna be a long day
15/03/2019, 10:45 - Luc Hayward: ? For you?
15/03/2019, 10:46 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Well you don't have lunch today 🤷🏻‍♂
15/03/2019, 10:58 - Luc Hayward: right... haha
15/03/2019, 10:59 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: * makes a joke *
15/03/2019, 11:58 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok new news
15/03/2019, 11:58 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I'm free until 2
15/03/2019, 12:00 - Luc Hayward: I should be back before 1?
15/03/2019, 12:20 - Luc Hayward: I'll be around from 12:45-1
15/03/2019, 12:20 - Luc Hayward: Till 2*
15/03/2019, 13:01 - Boyd Kane: I'm free, but did you guys here about the talk by Google about AMP?
15/03/2019, 13:01 - Boyd Kane: In CS 2A
15/03/2019, 13:02 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ah yeah, I'm not gonna go though
15/03/2019, 13:02 - Boyd Kane: You deleted this message
15/03/2019, 13:03 - Boyd Kane: Hoekom nie?
15/03/2019, 13:06 - Luc Hayward: Also probably not going
15/03/2019, 13:06 - Luc Hayward: Purely out of protest for how awful amp is
15/03/2019, 13:06 - Luc Hayward: makes me cry at least once a week
15/03/2019, 13:07 - Luc Hayward: but what time is it, I cuold be convinced
15/03/2019, 13:07 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Why so awful? 😂
15/03/2019, 13:07 - Luc Hayward: It just really annoys me
15/03/2019, 13:08 - Luc Hayward: the web pages don't actually work half the time
15/03/2019, 13:08 - Luc Hayward: sometimes I don't want to open something in the reddit app, stop making me do that to see the rest of the content
15/03/2019, 13:09 - Luc Hayward: stop making me have to manually edit the url, I should be able to just change to non-amp in one click or even better, just specify never serve me amp pages...
15/03/2019, 13:09 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh yeah this annoys me to no end 😂
15/03/2019, 13:10 - Luc Hayward: Also at least for me, half the time if I scroll down in a amp page and then I want to close the tab I have to scroll ALLL THE WAY UP to actually be able to open my tabs view and swipe the tab away. Why???
15/03/2019, 13:11 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I didn't realise all of this things were associated with AMP, but I hate those too 😂
15/03/2019, 13:11 - Luc Hayward: yeah
15/03/2019, 13:11 - Luc Hayward: its all amp
15/03/2019, 13:11 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: And when I try copy the page URL to send to someone it's a huge mission
15/03/2019, 13:12 - Luc Hayward: and whats worse is that everywhere is going to start using it because google (at least thats what I read, might not be true now) incentivises you providing an amp page and ranks them higher
15/03/2019, 13:12 - Luc Hayward: its such a pain
15/03/2019, 13:12 - Luc Hayward: Yes! you have to drage the cursor all the way to the start every time and its also the only way to load the non-amp page
15/03/2019, 13:13 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: This is what I call a dystopian future
15/03/2019, 14:05 - Boyd Kane: Guys you know it's open source right?
15/03/2019, 14:05 - Boyd Kane: And the talk was largely on getting started with OS
15/03/2019, 14:07 - Boyd Kane: Also, if anything works well, then you'll never notice it
15/03/2019, 14:11 - Luc Hayward: 😂 I know, the open source isn't making it any better yet
15/03/2019, 14:14 - Boyd Kane: I mean that you can fix the problems that irk you so

28/03/2019, 18:35 - Luc Hayward: This was great
28/03/2019, 18:35 - Luc Hayward: This is Disney? It's in my watch later still
28/03/2019, 19:58 - Boyd Kane: Disney has a research division apparently🤷🏻‍♂
28/03/2019, 20:01 - Boyd Kane: Disney Research is a network of research labs supporting The Walt Disney Company. Its purpose is to pursue scientific and technological innovation to advance the company's broad media and entertainment efforts.

It has facilities in Los Angeles, Zurich and Edinburgh. Research topics include *computer graphics, video processing, computer vision, robotics, radio and antennas, wireless communications, human-computer interaction, displays, data mining, machine learning, and behavioral sciences.* The lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts was closed in January 2016.

Disney Research is managed by an internal Disney Research Council co-chaired by Disney-Pixar's Ed Catmull and including the directors of the individual labs.

Notable works
BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan.
28/03/2019, 21:17 - Luc Hayward: Their research into humanoid robotic acrobatics is super cool
28/03/2019, 22:38 - Boyd Kane: Ahh I remember seeing this but not that it was Didney. Do you have a link?
28/03/2019, 22:47 - Luc Hayward: I'll find for you tomorrow, was on YouTube. Something like Disney robot stuntmen

02/04/2019, 10:54 - Boyd Kane: Although they'll take 'less than 12 hours' to get your data
02/04/2019, 10:56 - Luc Hayward: Yeah it's for deep storage so they also charge you to retrieve it
02/04/2019, 11:00 - Boyd Kane: What exactly do they do that takes 12 hours to get the data back though?
02/04/2019, 13:16 - Luc Hayward: I assume there's either HEAVY compression done, or else the data is either stored on HDD that are not always connected or maybe even stored on tape?
03/04/2019, 22:08 - Luc Hayward: The second is just stupid
03/04/2019, 22:10 - Boyd Kane: And the first I was just stupid
03/04/2019, 22:14 - Luc Hayward: That's weird...your security code just changed did you get a new phone?

19/04/2019, 01:02 - Luc Hayward: URL**
19/04/2019, 01:03 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: No that’s the point, it doesn’t say digitaltrends.com in the url bar, it shows the google url
19/04/2019, 01:04 - Luc Hayward: ...

19/04/2019, 01:04 - Luc Hayward: You didn't read the full article 😂
19/04/2019, 01:04 - Luc Hayward: It's just an optional thing which needs to be sorted by your cdn
19/04/2019, 01:05 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok nvm I thought you meant they were making amp hijack the URL bar in chrome and show digitaltrends.com instead of the amp address even when you’re on an amp page
19/04/2019, 01:05 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: No I didn’t 😂
19/04/2019, 01:05 - Luc Hayward: Oh no it will happen everywhere eventually

29/04/2019, 10:51 - Luc Hayward: But yeah
29/04/2019, 10:51 - Luc Hayward: All the files are just publicly read writeable which is definitely not intended
29/04/2019, 10:52 - Luc Hayward: But I don't have Sudo permission on the server so I can't change the file ownership (it should be setup that the web app owns the files and is the only one with read write access I think(
29/04/2019, 14:25 - Boyd Kane: ~Well Safla is just begging for it~ Oh what a pity that the permissions are all messed up.

08/05/2019, 15:30 - Luc Hayward: Did you know you can bookmark an entire chrome session? Like all the open tabs as a single session bookmark?
08/05/2019, 15:30 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Hm
09/05/2019, 09:34 - Boyd Kane: Hey all, so what's happening about this impact challenge?

10/05/2019, 13:25 - Luc Hayward: welcome
10/05/2019, 13:25 - Luc Hayward: I'm basically gone till tuesday
10/05/2019, 13:31 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ah can’t wait to see you (on Tuesday) 😆
10/05/2019, 13:31 - Luc Hayward: 👍
10/05/2019, 13:31 - Luc Hayward: bloody c++
10/05/2019, 14:59 - Boyd Kane: If either of you are still using Python, Kite is a pretty interesting concept. Think code completion but it scrubs GitHub in order to find the common completions. And it works with most IDEs

 https://kite.com/
Kite - AI Autocomplete for Python
10/05/2019, 15:49 - Luc Hayward: Not using python but that looks really cool
10/05/2019, 15:50 - Luc Hayward: is it only python? I assume its extendable to anything ?
10/05/2019, 16:00 - Boyd Kane: Yeah, I'm not sure why, but it's only python
10/05/2019, 17:40 - Luc Hayward: Is it open source at all?

12/05/2019, 15:01 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: It was about templates 😂
12/05/2019, 15:02 - Boyd Kane: I attended ~one of Luc’s C++~ lectures ~a week or two ago~

12/05/2019, 15:05 - Boyd Kane: @groupAdmin please make us all admin
12/05/2019, 15:06 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh I see
12/05/2019, 15:06 - Boyd Kane: Shush now, gotta study
12/05/2019, 15:06 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: How did you do this now?
12/05/2019, 15:12 - Luc Hayward: oh it is, that is tempalting, if you guys have a stunningly better way to do it I Pray.
12/05/2019, 15:14 - Luc Hayward: Basically I have an Audio class which holds a vector (of either int8, int16, pair<int8,int8> or pair<int16,int16>)
12/05/2019, 15:14 - Luc Hayward: And I only know what that will be at runtime (based on commandline args)
12/05/2019, 15:15 - Luc Hayward: So I don't know how to do it, because the ones with pair<> require specialised methods.
12/05/2019, 15:17 - Luc Hayward: This message was deleted
12/05/2019, 15:17 - Luc Hayward: So please for the love of god help if I'm just retarded

12/05/2019, 15:19 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Message does not compile
12/05/2019, 15:20 - Luc Hayward: oh
12/05/2019, 15:21 - Luc Hayward: So either I do this way (where its massive amounts of duplicate code but for effectively its  all exactly the same.)

Or I can change the templating but then I'm essentially reimplementing the entire Audio class for stereo (pair<>) and then there's less repeated code (probably in terms of LoC) *but* then I have more complex code repetition. At least the way I have it any changes can literally be done in one go using multiple cursors in your editor

 I legit write all the code the same I just need to instantiate the objects differently.
12/05/2019, 15:26 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I guess you could make templates for 1 and 2 channels and then make a template of those templates for 8 and 16 bits
12/05/2019, 15:26 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Could get freaky
12/05/2019, 15:27 - Luc Hayward: yeah so thats option B
12/05/2019, 15:27 - Luc Hayward: but it means that you duplicate complex functionality right?
12/05/2019, 15:28 - Luc Hayward: Cause I would much rather duplicate extremely simplistic code that can literally be edited just by using multiple cursors
12/05/2019, 15:28 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Is the A1 + A2 the complex functionality?
12/05/2019, 15:28 - Luc Hayward: instead of duplicating Audio functionality when things are potentially more complex to remember to change you know
12/05/2019, 15:29 - Luc Hayward: no thats piss thats what I'm saying
12/05/2019, 15:29 - Luc Hayward: I would rather write 4 sets of A1 + A2
12/05/2019, 15:29 - Luc Hayward: instead of 2 copies of this
12/05/2019, 15:29 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
12/05/2019, 15:31 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah 2 copies of this is definitely worse
12/05/2019, 15:31 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
12/05/2019, 15:32 - Luc Hayward: Cause actually some operators will need to change anyway
12/05/2019, 15:37 - Luc Hayward: Actually you know the other way may have been better but now I'm committed
12/05/2019, 15:37 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh
12/05/2019, 16:25 - Boyd Kane: ```>>> import this```
12/05/2019, 16:26 - Boyd Kane: ```Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!```

12/05/2019, 16:31 - Luc Hayward: Have actually seen it posted before but why the font
12/05/2019, 16:37 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Makes it look wiser
12/05/2019, 16:37 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: People who use typewriters are wiser than the rest of us

12/05/2019, 20:18 - Boyd Kane: But the source code should be available if you go looking
12/05/2019, 20:19 - Boyd Kane: While you're at it, ```>>>import antigravity```

12/05/2019, 20:22 - Boyd Kane: Can c-- do that?
12/05/2019, 20:22 - Luc Hayward: Yes
12/05/2019, 20:23 - Luc Hayward: No it cannot
12/05/2019, 20:23 - Luc Hayward: You'll just not compile
12/05/2019, 20:23 - Luc Hayward: You want #include, 😂
12/05/2019, 20:24 - Boyd Kane: I feel like #include antigravity is an oxymoron😂
12/05/2019, 20:24 - Boyd Kane: #exclude gravity
12/05/2019, 20:26 - Luc Hayward: #include <gravity>
Gravity * earth = new Gravity()*
earth->setGravity(-1)
12/05/2019, 20:26 - Luc Hayward: Fuck forgot my semicolons
12/05/2019, 20:30 - Boyd Kane: I had to do some java for applying to the Amazon internship yesterday (no news yet). This was pretty much every single time I went to compile
12/05/2019, 20:31 - Luc Hayward: Watch Boyd get this internship on his first try
12/05/2019, 20:31 - Luc Hayward: If you do I'm gonna be jelly and proud and my only excuse will be that you've had a year more Dev experience 😂
12/05/2019, 20:31 - Luc Hayward: It's a poor excuse and stu knows it
12/05/2019, 20:33 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: 😂

13/05/2019, 09:38 - Luc Hayward: I mean yeet
13/05/2019, 09:40 - Luc Hayward: Either they took out the online interview or (more likely) this is a phone call before the main application stuff?
13/05/2019, 09:40 - Luc Hayward: That's sick
13/05/2019, 09:46 - Boyd Kane: This is all I know, it's a 1hr phone call at some point in the next two weeks🤷🏻‍♂. I've let them know when I'm available
13/05/2019, 10:58 - Luc Hayward: Hmm I've no idea
13/05/2019, 10:59 - Luc Hayward: If it were the technical interview they would tell you in advance
13/05/2019, 12:12 - Boyd Kane: They've just sent through an information pack, it's a technical, live coding video interview with one of their engineers
13/05/2019, 12:39 - Luc Hayward: Oh lol wtf ok that's nice
13/05/2019, 12:40 - Luc Hayward: I'll chat to you about it this afternoon/tomorrow if you want any advice from when I did it
13/05/2019, 12:40 - Luc Hayward: Interesting that they're no doing the online prescreening tests for you
13/05/2019, 12:46 - Boyd Kane: Yeah I'd love to chat about it. Are you two still going to the honours talk?
13/05/2019, 12:47 - Luc Hayward: Yeah we are
13/05/2019, 12:47 - Luc Hayward: My time on the calendar is wrong it's at 1:30

13/05/2019, 18:21 - Luc Hayward: Which part?
13/05/2019, 18:21 - Luc Hayward: That just says "Wherever you see private, replace it with public"
13/05/2019, 18:21 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh that is evil 😂
13/05/2019, 18:21 - Luc Hayward: so it means in my unit testing file I can just do whatever I want without having to actually expose the inner workings of the class
13/05/2019, 18:21 - Luc Hayward: It's wrong
13/05/2019, 18:21 - Luc Hayward: but it works
13/05/2019, 20:29 - Boyd Kane: 𓂊
13/05/2019, 20:29 - Boyd Kane: Can either of you see that?

16/05/2019, 10:09 - Boyd Kane: 😂 this is actually really creepy
16/05/2019, 10:09 - Boyd Kane: Also, OnePlus just released a 12 hour video on YouTube of the 7 Pro's front facing camera going up and down and up and down
16/05/2019, 10:10 - Boyd Kane: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y5UTFEDfvWs
🎥 OnePlus 7 Pro - Front camera 12-hour stress test - YouTube
16/05/2019, 10:16 - Luc Hayward: Something like 120 movements a day for 5 years that it's validated gor
16/05/2019, 10:19 - Boyd Kane: Except that they haven't actually tested it for 5 years🤷🏻‍♂. I'm sure it'll stand the test though
16/05/2019, 10:22 - Luc Hayward: Haven't they?
16/05/2019, 10:23 - Boyd Kane: It was only released yesterday, how could they have?
16/05/2019, 10:23 - Luc Hayward: ....
16/05/2019, 10:23 - Luc Hayward: Because they've been testing the phone for ages before that😂
16/05/2019, 10:24 - Luc Hayward: Also 120 times a day for 5 years is only 220k opens
16/05/2019, 10:25 - Luc Hayward: Even if it could only be opened once every 3 seconds that's only 7 days of testing
16/05/2019, 10:26 - Boyd Kane: Sorry, you're correct🙈

16/05/2019, 15:39 - Boyd Kane: Stu: 'Cancerous'😉
16/05/2019, 15:46 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: What? 😂
16/05/2019, 15:58 - Luc Hayward: I'm confused
16/05/2019, 22:15 - Boyd Kane: Sorry😂. I'm still laughing at that time when Stu said that working with hardware was cancerous
16/05/2019, 22:15 - Luc Hayward: I don't remember 😂😂
16/05/2019, 23:25 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I remember saying that about web dev, but I thought I used less extreme language for hardware 🤦🏻‍♂😂
17/05/2019, 08:30 - Boyd Kane: 😂okay, I think I probably agree with you for the web development side of things

27/05/2019, 18:00 - Luc Hayward: They do take a while
27/05/2019, 18:01 - Luc Hayward: Oh Stu doesn't have access to that repo he's never actually done a technical interview

29/05/2019, 17:04 - Boyd Kane: I'm actually really excited about this. Slight side question, do you know if I'm allowed to keep the lecture slides on GitHub?, or does UCT have licensing to them...
29/05/2019, 17:08 - Luc Hayward: Some lecturers might cry but no we UCT generally don't have exclusive licence
29/05/2019, 17:08 - Luc Hayward: but just put them in a private repo?
29/05/2019, 17:08 - Luc Hayward: You have github student pack surely
29/05/2019, 17:08 - Luc Hayward: https://education.github.com/pack/offers

Incase you don't
29/05/2019, 17:09 - Boyd Kane: Why put them on GitHub just to hide it from the world? If I'm bothered then I'll just ignore the slides.
29/05/2019, 17:11 - Luc Hayward: Because you can have the  code up and just only have like a sample of input data
29/05/2019, 17:11 - Luc Hayward: that's what I did with my stuff (infact I think I didn't even put the data ) for the research shit
29/05/2019, 17:12 - Boyd Kane: So have the code public but just not add the input data / only add a small sample of the input data?
29/05/2019, 17:14 - Luc Hayward: yeah
29/05/2019, 17:15 - Luc Hayward: But obviously in your readme you can also show that it does work
29/05/2019, 17:16 - Luc Hayward: or just ask that lecturer
29/05/2019, 17:16 - Luc Hayward: Cause I know there will be some who wouldn't be your best friend if you put all their work online for anybody
29/05/2019, 17:17 - Boyd Kane: It is a bit of a 🍆 move, I'll take them down
29/05/2019, 17:18 - Luc Hayward: Like maybe just only have 1 lecture pack?
29/05/2019, 17:19 - Boyd Kane: Nah, I'm building the program, not the results. I'll make sure to flesh out how to use it though, and maybe I'll find some dummy/open source data to use
29/05/2019, 17:19 - Boyd Kane: But definitely going to have the results and graphs in the REAME eventually
29/05/2019, 17:20 - Luc Hayward: Yeah that would be great idea

So stuff like making <= into one symbol
30/05/2019, 09:30 - Luc Hayward: .... Did you just tell me to make a new account and ignore the old one 😂😂

01/06/2019, 00:17 - Luc Hayward: Not sure what you would use it for
01/06/2019, 00:17 - Luc Hayward: but if you're ever doing something that they have docs for they're nice
01/06/2019, 09:45 - Boyd Kane: I know right?! I had a look at their web development things and it's really well put together
01/06/2019, 09:47 - Luc Hayward: Web dev as in networking or programming? Only seen their networking theory docs and C#/C++(which are great)
01/06/2019, 10:07 - Boyd Kane: It was on the Mozilla page, but about CSS HTML JS
01/06/2019, 10:29 - Luc Hayward: Oh cool
01/06/2019, 11:09 - Luc Hayward: Boyd you need a lift tonight?
01/06/2019, 11:38 - Luc Hayward: Either of your (boyd) want to one sentence explain whether to use single, double or triple quotes in python
01/06/2019, 11:39 - Luc Hayward: And whether to use apostrophes or quote marksd
01/06/2019, 11:48 - Luc Hayward: doesn't matter
01/06/2019, 11:49 - Luc Hayward: no idea, don't think double works but triple means new lines don't need to be escaped

01/06/2019, 15:40 - Boyd Kane: Yeah I think they were just extrapolating to say that this thing could become bad
01/06/2019, 16:09 - Luc Hayward: Right
01/06/2019, 16:44 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: How are we lifting?
01/06/2019, 16:45 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Luc would you mind picking us up or do you want to go my car from my house?
01/06/2019, 16:57 - Luc Hayward: I don't mind lifting, pretty sure I have petrol.....
01/06/2019, 16:58 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok what time are you coming? 😂
01/06/2019, 17:00 - Luc Hayward: Hmm may have buggered up my timing a bit here with fetching tyger
01/06/2019, 17:01 - Luc Hayward: Told him I'd meet him at Westlake gym at 6:30
01/06/2019, 17:01 - Luc Hayward: so would get to you @27722193705 at 6:43
01/06/2019, 17:01 - Luc Hayward: get to boyd at 7
01/06/2019, 17:01 - Luc Hayward: Get to late by 7:15 (including parking)
01/06/2019, 17:10 - Boyd Kane: Is it too late to shuffle Tyger forward by 20 minutes (including picking up Tyger)?
01/06/2019, 17:11 - Luc Hayward: I can try
01/06/2019, 17:11 - Luc Hayward: Can't reach the man
01/06/2019, 17:13 - Luc Hayward: Been trying to get hold of him since just before 5
01/06/2019, 17:16 - Luc Hayward: Moved it 20 Min earlier

03/06/2019, 12:55 - Luc Hayward: wtf boyd xD
03/06/2019, 13:04 - Boyd Kane: You were saying?
03/06/2019, 13:04 - Luc Hayward: 😂
03/06/2019, 13:04 - Luc Hayward: Shrek is love Shrek is life
03/06/2019, 13:04 - Boyd Kane: I do, but I really don't understand them
03/06/2019, 13:05 - Luc Hayward: do you use virtualenv or pipenv?
03/06/2019, 13:05 - Boyd Kane: Anaconda+PyCharm just makes it more difficult not to use them
03/06/2019, 13:05 - Boyd Kane: Conda
03/06/2019, 13:05 - Luc Hayward: what's Anaconda?
03/06/2019, 13:06 - Boyd Kane: A package manager that also makes various scientific python packages a lot easier
03/06/2019, 13:06 - Luc Hayward: oh better than pip/
03/06/2019, 13:07 - Boyd Kane: 🤷🏻‍♂I didn't really do my due diligence, and now I'm too scared to change over and break everything
03/06/2019, 13:08 - Luc Hayward: omg😂😂
03/06/2019, 13:18 - Luc Hayward: you've yet to run into issues where you needed to install via pip?
03/06/2019, 13:21 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I don’t usually use virtual environments, but when I do I use virtualenv because it’s the default thing built into python and I’m a default kind of a guy
03/06/2019, 13:22 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I mean I also use the default email app on my phone so make it that what you will
03/06/2019, 13:22 - Luc Hayward: except I think pyenv is the new "default" xD
03/06/2019, 13:22 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: But also the people at dataprophet used virtualenv _everywhere_ so they definitely biased me
03/06/2019, 13:23 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh I have no idea what’s cracking over there
03/06/2019, 13:25 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: * make of that
03/06/2019, 13:27 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: They’re different things it seems
https://stackoverflow.com/a/29950604
03/06/2019, 13:27 - Luc Hayward: think virtual env is the lower level thing that pyenv and pipenv are built on?
03/06/2019, 13:28 - Luc Hayward: why is it confusing!!!
03/06/2019, 13:30 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: This says venv is just python whereas pyenv is bash stuff so I’d still just use venv 😆
03/06/2019, 13:30 - Luc Hayward: virtualenv seems like a pain though?
03/06/2019, 13:30 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Pyenv sounds fiddly
03/06/2019, 13:30 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: No it’s amazingly easy
03/06/2019, 13:30 - Luc Hayward: From what I can tell it copies the entire python version to that directory surely that makes for massive project folders?
03/06/2019, 13:32 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I don’t remember thinking the files were that big, but it does give you a “clean slate” to pip install stuff on without worrying about messing up versions and stuff for your other projects
03/06/2019, 13:33 - Luc Hayward: yeah no I know that
03/06/2019, 13:33 - Luc Hayward: Well how big is a project for you?
03/06/2019, 13:33 - Luc Hayward: Are you at your laptop can you compare quick with mine?
03/06/2019, 13:33 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I’ll go check
03/06/2019, 13:33 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Actually I’ll just make a new venv now and see how big is
03/06/2019, 13:33 - Luc Hayward: wait
03/06/2019, 13:33 - Luc Hayward: go to Networks0Xs
03/06/2019, 13:33 - Luc Hayward: cause we both have that
03/06/2019, 13:34 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: But it’s a nice little one liner to make one
03/06/2019, 13:34 - Luc Hayward: isn't venv different to virtualenv
03/06/2019, 13:34 - Luc Hayward: brb
03/06/2019, 13:34 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: No pycharm just called the folder venv but you can call it whatever you want
03/06/2019, 13:35 - Luc Hayward: my networks0Xs is 127KB
03/06/2019, 13:35 - Luc Hayward: brb
03/06/2019, 13:42 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
03/06/2019, 13:42 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: It says you can use --symlinks if you don't want it to make a copy
03/06/2019, 13:47 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh nvm I googled it actually is
03/06/2019, 13:47 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: venv is apparently the lightweight version
03/06/2019, 13:47 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I was using venv
03/06/2019, 13:52 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I always typed:
python3 -m venv venv
to make one and then:
source venv/bin/activate
to activate it
03/06/2019, 14:12 - Luc Hayward: Yeah and then when you're done source venv/bin/deactivate right
03/06/2019, 14:13 - Luc Hayward: And does venv integrate nicely with pycharm? I think it can all be taken care of automatically tight?
03/06/2019, 14:13 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Nah to deactivate you can just type “deactivate”
03/06/2019, 14:13 - Luc Hayward: Right*
03/06/2019, 14:13 - Luc Hayward: Ok and then jupyter notebooks. Where and when to use them and why and what for
03/06/2019, 14:14 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I assume pycharm is already trying to make us use venv if it’s making folder called venv
03/06/2019, 14:15 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Jupyter notebooks run a little web server and you open it in your browser and can type notes + little blocks of python code you can run
03/06/2019, 14:15 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Google Colab is a Jupyter notebook so just open one if you want to see what it is
03/06/2019, 14:15 - Luc Hayward: ah my bad you're right, venv is the recommended method now on the python hmoepage
03/06/2019, 14:17 - Luc Hayward: venv doesn't copy python binaries
03/06/2019, 14:17 - Luc Hayward: https://towardsdatascience.com/comparing-python-virtual-environment-tools-9a6543643a44
03/06/2019, 14:17 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ah
03/06/2019, 14:18 - Luc Hayward: my pycharm doesn't do that, you're probably doing this
03/06/2019, 14:18 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Venv does copy something though because I just tried making one and it was 8.6 mb
03/06/2019, 14:18 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh
03/06/2019, 14:18 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
03/06/2019, 14:18 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh
03/06/2019, 14:19 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: If you make one on your laptop via the command line is it also this big?
03/06/2019, 14:20 - Luc Hayward: just via commandline or via pycharm?
03/06/2019, 14:21 - Luc Hayward: yeah I think there are notebooks for a lot of different languages?
03/06/2019, 14:21 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh yeah this 8.6 mb is all pip stuff
03/06/2019, 14:22 - Boyd Kane: Yeah, you can download kernels for Java. I use it for CSC notes
03/06/2019, 14:23 - Luc Hayward: I woner if that is different to letting pycharm use virtualenv
03/06/2019, 14:31 - Luc Hayward: ok so testing it with networked0Xs
03/06/2019, 14:32 - Luc Hayward: curretn size 120KB
03/06/2019, 14:33 - Luc Hayward: adding virtualenv with inheriting global packages
03/06/2019, 14:36 - Luc Hayward: letting pycharm handle the virtualenv doesn't increase file size drastically
03/06/2019, 14:37 - Luc Hayward: also stu remember we were trying to find a way to see and then update all the packages that need updating?
03/06/2019, 14:37 - Luc Hayward: You can do it in python EASY
03/06/2019, 14:37 - Luc Hayward: globally and linked to a virtualenv
03/06/2019, 14:49 - Luc Hayward: Any changes from the inherited ones are added though I think
03/06/2019, 14:49 - Luc Hayward: this is all via pycharm not commandline
03/06/2019, 14:54 - Luc Hayward: almost all sometimes there are errors
03/06/2019, 21:01 - Luc Hayward: <------------------------------------->
03/06/2019, 21:03 - Luc Hayward: This wwdc brought to you .... Very late
03/06/2019, 21:04 - Luc Hayward: iOS being separated on iPads into iPadOS
03/06/2019, 21:08 - Luc Hayward: Apple shows coming this fall. No pricing yet
03/06/2019, 21:10 - Luc Hayward: TvOS redesign ish
03/06/2019, 21:12 - Luc Hayward: Apple music to show lyrics in sync on Apple tv
03/06/2019, 21:12 - Luc Hayward: TV app going on regular smart TVs though I think???
03/06/2019, 21:13 - Luc Hayward: Now you can have a fucking bird (recorded at Apple park of course) chime every hour (or a haptic tap) ew
03/06/2019, 21:14 - Luc Hayward: Calculator on watch
03/06/2019, 21:14 - Luc Hayward: Tips and split bills included
03/06/2019, 21:14 - Luc Hayward: Apple's books and voice memos.... Apps can run on watch without a pair app on the iphone
03/06/2019, 21:15 - Luc Hayward: Apps (on watch) can read data for longer and new streaming api for audio (Spotify not shown but surely supported)
03/06/2019, 21:16 - Luc Hayward: App Store direct on the watch (this is good)
03/06/2019, 21:16 - Luc Hayward: Added trends to Apple fitness data
03/06/2019, 21:16 - Luc Hayward: Watch will tell you if audio in the area is dangerously loud
03/06/2019, 21:17 - Luc Hayward: Can also give realtime dB readout (no recorded audio)
03/06/2019, 21:18 - Luc Hayward: Cycle (as in female not bike) tracking on watch. Doubt you guys care but anyway interesting
03/06/2019, 21:20 - Luc Hayward: Android 9 at 10 percent adoption vs 85 for iOS 12. Honestly closer than I expected
03/06/2019, 21:21 - Luc Hayward: FaceID 30% faster ... K big whoop
03/06/2019, 21:21 - Boyd Kane: But still not on any MacBooks?
03/06/2019, 21:21 - Luc Hayward: New app packing to make apps and updates 50 and 60% smaller respectively
03/06/2019, 21:21 - Luc Hayward: Shhhhh I'm reading!

03/06/2019, 21:23 - Luc Hayward: Still using gboard though
03/06/2019, 21:24 - Luc Hayward: Also on iphone
03/06/2019, 21:25 - Luc Hayward: Safari gets per website preferences, mail gets desktop formatting and fonts, notes gets shared folders
03/06/2019, 21:25 - Luc Hayward: Reminders gets NLP for guessing the date it sounds like
03/06/2019, 21:26 - Luc Hayward: Hmm sounds better than that, Siri will find actionable words like names and you can tap that to remind you about it in your messages ?
03/06/2019, 21:27 - Luc Hayward: Apple maps gets essentially Google street view. New maps coming to US this year followed by select other countries
03/06/2019, 21:27 - Luc Hayward: Smoother movement though than Streetview it seems
03/06/2019, 21:31 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
03/06/2019, 21:31 - Luc Hayward: Can be disabled (the emails) whenever

03/06/2019, 21:33 - Luc Hayward: Some routers getting some sort of firewall integration. Not sure.
03/06/2019, 21:33 - Luc Hayward: It's homekit
03/06/2019, 21:35 - Luc Hayward: New portrait lighting effects in camera. 

Improvements to photo editing include noise reduction. Interface applied to video too, videos can be rotated.
03/06/2019, 21:36 - Luc Hayward: Going to use ML to remove duplicate photos and clutter (like receipts, think how Google photos suggests you should archive some stuff)
03/06/2019, 21:36 - Luc Hayward: Airpods: Siri can read incoming messages and let you resoond
03/06/2019, 21:37 - Luc Hayward: No need to say hey siri

03/06/2019, 21:39 - Luc Hayward: Neural text to speech used to synthesise everything (no audio clips from real people). Demo is apparently better on correct emohasis
03/06/2019, 21:40 - Luc Hayward: Low data mode and able to select WiFi networks from control centre. 

Dolby atmos supoort and iMessage to work with dual SIM somehow??
03/06/2019, 21:42 - Luc Hayward: iPadOS, so far home screen looks the same but with tighter app grid. Can swipe over to pin widgets on home screen ? 

Changes I didn't really follow to how you swap between apps
03/06/2019, 21:43 - Luc Hayward: Can now finally have two of the same app open in split screen I think. Something else I didn't follow. 

Seems like multiple instances of a single app can be opened. 

Apparently a lot of this stuff is complex and would need someone to show you rather than just discovering it
03/06/2019, 21:44 - Luc Hayward: Files to get column view ? Zip/unzip coming too. Couldn't tell if the comment about thumb drives being readable was a joke but it looks like direct import from camera is a thing
03/06/2019, 21:46 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
03/06/2019, 21:46 - Luc Hayward: Apple pencil latency halved from 29 to 9 ms

03/06/2019, 21:49 - Luc Hayward: No release date for iOS or iPadOS. Stu the beta program for iPhone is usually not too bad. Easier than Mac cause not as much of an issue if some features are buggy
03/06/2019, 21:50 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
03/06/2019, 21:53 - Luc Hayward: Shipping with a 28 core xeon up to 1.5TB of RAM and up to 8 PCIe expansion slots( 4 double wide, 3 single and last one prefilled with an IO Card from Apple featuring thunderbolt, USB A ports and 2 10gig Ethernet ports). Has headphone jack😂

03/06/2019, 21:54 - Luc Hayward: Graphics card is weird...supports up to 509watts but just a giant heatsink with no fans.  Can be configured with Radeon pro Vega (up to two)
03/06/2019, 21:54 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Is it still happening now?
03/06/2019, 21:54 - Luc Hayward: Weird it looks like the connector could be custom
03/06/2019, 21:54 - Luc Hayward: I'm reading the interesting bits of the verges live coverage to you guys, not sure if it's still going I doubt it
03/06/2019, 21:55 - Luc Hayward: Pro Vega 2*
03/06/2019, 21:55 - Luc Hayward: Afterburner (name) card is for video editing, it's an FPGA ASIC card capable of 6 billion pixels per second (whatever that means) so 8k editing possible apparently.
03/06/2019, 21:56 - Luc Hayward: Claims to handle 3x8k prores streams or 12x4k
03/06/2019, 21:56 - Luc Hayward: 1400 watt psu
03/06/2019, 21:57 - Luc Hayward: Can put the feet on wheels
03/06/2019, 21:57 - Luc Hayward: Lots of airflow through the chassis
03/06/2019, 21:59 - Luc Hayward: Lots of pro programs have announced support (duh but probably means that the mac programs will be tested on the new hardware seeing as before Mac's weren't even remotely capable of some of this stuff. ),Adobe, blackmagic, red, epic, unity, Pixar, Otoys octane programs.
03/06/2019, 21:59 - Luc Hayward: Managing to run 1000+ audio tracks in logic

P3 color, 10 bit, reference modes

Purports wider viewing angles and has an anti reflective coating. Separate from the Matt option which apple claims uses a glass etching technology to reduce fuzziness of the image.
03/06/2019, 22:03 - Luc Hayward: Rear backplate acts as heatsink allowing for indefinite 1000nits peak brightness
03/06/2019, 22:04 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
03/06/2019, 22:05 - Luc Hayward: Calling it "extreme dynamic range" as opposed to high. 

Named the pro display XDR

03/06/2019, 22:12 - Luc Hayward: Is this rip Wacom ? Probably not but it's fantastic for people wanting fully fledged use of the desktop stuff.
03/06/2019, 22:12 - Luc Hayward: MacOS and iOS getting improved voice control accessibility features
03/06/2019, 22:13 - Luc Hayward: Attention awareness intended to change your voice commands to target the device you focus on dynamically

Twitter has native Mac app again. Took "just days"
03/06/2019, 22:18 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>

10/06/2019, 01:06 - Luc Hayward: Lol wrong group soz
10/06/2019, 14:13 - Luc Hayward: So I think that there is technically a massive issue in the grant applications thing I was maintaining that would let anyone who knew the name, staffID and email for a staffmember access their grant application
10/06/2019, 14:19 - Luc Hayward: Like the original guy has written that they hide it behind a uuid for each user but....they straight up don't xD
10/06/2019, 16:04 - Boyd Kane: 😂 lovely. Does it look like the original guy was just too lazy to do it?
10/06/2019, 16:51 - Luc Hayward: It looks like he wanted to do it right and then never found a food way to do ir
10/06/2019, 18:36 - Luc Hayward: Like it should all work except for the fact that only the server knows the UUID, and it's just sitting it in a lookup table keyed to the staffID
10/06/2019, 18:37 - Luc Hayward: It's really bad actually 😂
10/06/2019, 18:39 - Luc Hayward: I don't see a way to solve it either without massively changing how things are done 😂

12/06/2019, 16:55 - Luc Hayward: I accidentally made a 20GB file by piping out my terminal

Well thats scary
15/06/2019, 22:48 - Boyd Kane: And the best part is that there are probably deepfakes out there convincing people, we just haven't been able to spot them
15/06/2019, 22:49 - Luc Hayward: Nah they're still pretty hard to spot tbh
15/06/2019, 22:49 - Luc Hayward: pretty easy *
15/06/2019, 22:49 - Luc Hayward: But yeah some are very convincing but there is still a certain level of suspension of disbelief needed
15/06/2019, 22:51 - Boyd Kane: Yeah, if the quality is decent, but people will still share a shaky, badly compressed video if they think it's funny, so just take the uncanny valley videos and compress them hectically
15/06/2019, 22:51 - Luc Hayward: yeah true ture

16/06/2019, 11:25 - Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/dKjCWfuvYxQ
16/06/2019, 11:25 - Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/gCuG-KJacp8
16/06/2019, 11:25 - Luc Hayward: Watch this second
16/06/2019, 11:25 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh they fight back now oh dear 😂
16/06/2019, 11:27 - Luc Hayward: It's great.
16/06/2019, 22:08 - Boyd Kane: https://youtu.be/Fow7iUaKrq4

17/06/2019, 11:03 - Luc Hayward: Clearly related
17/06/2019, 16:16 - Luc Hayward: Did you know mutable default arguments in python are effectively static (ie only one exists for the program)
17/06/2019, 17:22 - Boyd Kane: No, but I do know that python's pass-by-reference/value is logical but in a very convoluted way which I think causes the static thing
17/06/2019, 17:25 - Luc Hayward: Yeah so like if you have some function 
Def append(Val, ls = []):
    ls.append(val)
    Print(ls)
 
And you call 
append(a)
Append(b)

The output will be 
A
Ab 

And not 
A
B

As you might expect
18/06/2019, 03:26 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Never would’ve guessed that
18/06/2019, 08:53 - Luc Hayward: Right? The default variable is created at the default definition.
18/06/2019, 08:53 - Luc Hayward: Apparently it's intended for storing state for things like Cashing functions
18/06/2019, 08:53 - Luc Hayward: If you pass in your argument it works as normal
18/06/2019, 10:42 - Luc Hayward: Another two pros for venv
18/06/2019, 10:43 - Luc Hayward: A) python and python3 link to the same command (different filepaths but both open a python3 shell)
18/06/2019, 10:43 - Luc Hayward: and B) Pycharm's terminal window starts with the venv activated
18/06/2019, 13:53 - Luc Hayward: I have decide ORMs are beautiful constructions, never again should one write sql by hand (even though it feels easier)
18/06/2019, 13:54 - Luc Hayward: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/queries/

This incase you are curious.....actually I hope this is the ORM and not something else lol
18/06/2019, 14:11 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I share the sentiment
18/06/2019, 14:11 - Luc Hayward: You've used?
18/06/2019, 14:11 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: The Django one a little bit
18/06/2019, 14:12 - Luc Hayward: Wait so you used Django and when I was asking about whether to use flask or Django ages ago you just shrugged ! 👎
18/06/2019, 14:13 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I haven’t used flask so how would I know? 😂
18/06/2019, 14:13 - Luc Hayward: you could have given your opinion on DJango! haha
18/06/2019, 14:14 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: And I only used django for 3 days!
18/06/2019, 14:23 - Luc Hayward: 3 more days than me 😋
18/06/2019, 14:23 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok 😂
18/06/2019, 14:32 - Boyd Kane: ELI5 ORMs?
18/06/2019, 14:33 - Luc Hayward: Map objects to relational databases, abstract the sql queries away
18/06/2019, 14:33 - Boyd Kane: I just realised how niche this question is😂
18/06/2019, 14:54 - Luc Hayward: hhmmmm like you're 5...

Instead of using pencil crayons to make pretty picture, just hand mommy and daddy the colours you like and then ask them to draw for you

24/06/2019, 11:51 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Maybe pycharm mines bitcoin in the background
24/06/2019, 11:53 - Luc Hayward: Nope
24/06/2019, 11:53 - Luc Hayward: Take a big pycharm project
24/06/2019, 11:54 - Luc Hayward: something with say 10k unique files
24/06/2019, 11:54 - Luc Hayward: copy that from one pycharm window (the original project) to a new pycharm window (another project) using pycharm instead of finder
24/06/2019, 11:55 - Luc Hayward: watch the indexing process grind to a hault (lots of git if you're wondering why there are so many files)
24/06/2019, 11:56 - Boyd Kane: That actually makes sense🙈😂
24/06/2019, 12:00 - Luc Hayward: Was horrible 😂
24/06/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: Go here and let me know your thoughts

24/06/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: Don't intentionally fuck anything up but just see how it goes
24/06/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: I want you to do the whole thing
24/06/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: pretend like you want to come to UCT
24/06/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: Signup, fill out an application
24/06/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: the data you put will all be deleted anyway eventually btw
24/06/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: Will owe you chocolate or something for helping me test
24/06/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: Also emails aren't required to exist so long as they are unique and correctly formatted
24/06/2019, 22:40 - Luc Hayward: 💜
24/06/2019, 22:47 - Luc Hayward: Not a big rush, tomorrow is fine
25/06/2019, 08:20 - Boyd Kane: I think you need to have the UCT blurb when asking for their race, and then when I clicked save application it seems like it submitted it immediately, but everything's good otherwise👍🏼
25/06/2019, 08:53 - Luc Hayward: The UCT blurb?
25/06/2019, 08:54 - Luc Hayward: And yeah saving and submitting are the exact same thing I'm probably going to remove that option and just have Submit (with a note that you can still edit) and then withdraw (this is required just not in yet)
25/06/2019, 10:44 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Hehe
25/06/2019, 10:44 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Mind if I only do it this evening?
25/06/2019, 10:45 - Luc Hayward: That's cool
25/06/2019, 14:28 - Boyd Kane: I don't think you can legally ask for someone to give their race, and if you do then it has to be optional and UCT has a blurb about only using it for research/demographics purposes and not for discrimination
25/06/2019, 14:29 - Boyd Kane: I think the CS department could give you some legalese to copy paste in this regard
25/06/2019, 14:46 - Luc Hayward: Warn me before you do I'm not pushing changes there at the moment
25/06/2019, 14:47 - Luc Hayward: 😂 I'll ask Tommie again, the requirements just say "Race, black or white"
25/06/2019, 15:09 - Luc Hayward: Like no point you looking at it without giving me a heads up I mean 👍

09/07/2019, 20:50 - Boyd Kane: The writing really started to go south after Capaldi became the doctor, but before that was decent
10/07/2019, 08:37 - Luc Hayward: Want that when Moffat really started to step back ?
10/07/2019, 08:37 - Luc Hayward: Yeah I watched up to pay in Capaldi wanted to know whether to pick it back up
10/07/2019, 08:42 - Boyd Kane: Basically I didn't really like the writing for most of Capaldi, so I haven't watched anything after him🤷🏻‍♂

You will note that this site does not operate on HTTPS (like literally everything should these days) and so I kindly(rudely because this was around the time they basically told Stu to fuck off about resetting passwords) emailed them to have it fixed. ..... Yeah no they just told me to piss off basically
10/07/2019, 18:45 - Luc Hayward: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/09/github_deepnude_code_discord/
10/07/2019, 21:08 - Boyd Kane: I mean, most people have no clue about how advanced machine learning is right now. I just hope that  when the first DeepNude is released as a 'leak', enough people will realise that this tech exists so that it won't cause significant harm to whoever was targeted
11/07/2019, 09:14 - Luc Hayward: It was already released and selling for 50 dollars on Windows Linux and Android I think
11/07/2019, 09:14 - Luc Hayward: Oh the first fake photo😂
11/07/2019, 09:15 - Luc Hayward: Well I've no idea how accurate it looked it could have been ultra shit like the original deepfakes
11/07/2019, 10:29 - Boyd Kane: True, but I think it's important that the public know when this sort of deepfake tech crosses the boundary into believability, which is a lot more believable if they see it slowly get better rather than just announce when they become perfect
11/07/2019, 10:31 - Boyd Kane: But it's tricky. I definitely wouldn't want to be the guinea pig to have DeepNudes made of me just so everyone can see where the tech is at
11/07/2019, 10:34 - Luc Hayward: Did you watch corridor crews video on faking Tom cruise?
11/07/2019, 10:35 - Boyd Kane: Yeah
11/07/2019, 10:35 - Luc Hayward: 😂 you're safe, only works on girls because there aren't enough naked guys on the internet
11/07/2019, 10:35 - Luc Hayward: Was impressive but less impressive that I expected

11/07/2019, 20:17 - Luc Hayward: No it's where mine would be hosted but that never went live on time
11/07/2019, 20:17 - Luc Hayward: But I wanted you to see that they're dumb and also told me to fuckoff about the HTTPS stuff
11/07/2019, 20:21 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh good yeah they are dumb 😂 They also gave me useless responses and didn’t fix the issue I told them about
11/07/2019, 20:25 - Luc Hayward: Especially cause their excuse was "expensive" but there are free SSL providers
13/07/2019, 21:39 - Boyd Kane: Ben Eater is a mad lad. Just busy watching him make a VGA graphics card with breadboards😂🙈
13/07/2019, 21:59 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I saw that on the YouTube recommender. Looked so cool
14/07/2019, 00:28 - Luc Hayward: Is this the guy you showed me Stu?
14/07/2019, 02:15 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah the guy I showed you at 1am or something 😆

17/07/2019, 21:50 - Boyd Kane: So the shells for the iPhone 11 are out, and literally the only change from the X is that they've now got 3 cameras on the back. What do you guys think the odds are that Apple is going to release some AR glasses this year? (To account for the lacking iPhone)
17/07/2019, 22:14 - Luc Hayward: Nope
17/07/2019, 22:15 - Luc Hayward: No chance at all
17/07/2019, 22:15 - Luc Hayward: Also if they actually go with the sweetie cameras I'll cry because that design is so incredibly ugly
17/07/2019, 22:19 - Boyd Kane: _laughs in kotlin_
17/07/2019, 22:19 - Luc Hayward: ?
17/07/2019, 22:30 - Boyd Kane: The design won't bother me if I don't have to hold it🤷🏻‍♂

18/07/2019, 13:17 - Luc Hayward: Not if this is the main challenge
18/07/2019, 13:18 - Luc Hayward: I only want to do the university cup
18/07/2019, 13:18 - Luc Hayward: The main one is too time consuming I think
18/07/2019, 13:19 - Boyd Kane: Yeah just the 1-day event
18/07/2019, 13:20 - Luc Hayward: Yeah we're keen, upsetting that it's only 3 people this year and not 4
18/07/2019, 13:21 - Luc Hayward: Cause we were meant to go with Keegan again.... Rip
18/07/2019, 13:22 - Boyd Kane: Is Keegan out of the picture?
18/07/2019, 13:22 - Luc Hayward: Registered
18/07/2019, 13:25 - Luc Hayward: I...do not know
18/07/2019, 13:27 - Boyd Kane: What's this about then?🙈
18/07/2019, 13:28 - Luc Hayward: He wants to do it again. If Stu is out then Keegan can join us Boyd. And if not then I'll go with Keegan and you two go together
18/07/2019, 13:28 - Luc Hayward: But we 3 will definitely do ACM together if you're keen
18/07/2019, 13:31 - Boyd Kane: Is the max team size only 3 people then?
18/07/2019, 13:31 - Luc Hayward: Yeah
18/07/2019, 13:31 - Boyd Kane: ACM?
18/07/2019, 13:32 - Boyd Kane: Also they've got a demo of Worms and it's really fun😂
18/07/2019, 13:32 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
18/07/2019, 13:32 - Luc Hayward: ACM is a big international competition
18/07/2019, 13:32 - Luc Hayward: @27722193705 do you remember when it is ?
18/07/2019, 14:03 - Boyd Kane: Verbosity++;
18/07/2019, 15:39 - Luc Hayward: 😂
18/07/2019, 15:40 - Luc Hayward: Yeah
18/07/2019, 15:40 - Luc Hayward: So next Thursday (25th) there's a seminar by Dr Shock "A walk through the landscape of reinforcement learning" 1-2pm... I'm going
18/07/2019, 16:09 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: See you there 👍🏻
18/07/2019, 16:10 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: In 2017 it was near the end of October
18/07/2019, 16:13 - Luc Hayward: I'm assuming that you guys won't fill a third so if Keegan can't make it (once the date is released), then I'll join you two obviously
18/07/2019, 16:13 - Luc Hayward: Right right
18/07/2019, 17:34 - Boyd Kane: Keen. Could you send me the email?
18/07/2019, 17:56 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Me too please
18/07/2019, 18:08 - Luc Hayward: No email

23/07/2019, 09:03 - Luc Hayward: Should know today whether I'm with you guys or with keegan
23/07/2019, 09:42 - Luc Hayward: Gonna register with you guys, Keegan has a concert the night before
23/07/2019, 09:42 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok
23/07/2019, 09:50 - Luc Hayward: Who's gonna register the team
23/07/2019, 10:13 - Luc Hayward: Same practice problem as last year but surely not the same final problem?
23/07/2019, 10:15 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I vote you as team captain and master of administration 📜
23/07/2019, 10:15 - Luc Hayward: like the practice problems are the same, and last year the actual probem was just a bigger version of the practice one
23/07/2019, 10:15 - Luc Hayward: ok
23/07/2019, 10:15 - Luc Hayward: Team name/
23/07/2019, 10:16 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Autocomplete didn’t offer me any good team names sorry

23/07/2019, 10:21 - Boyd Kane: Okay I've requested
23/07/2019, 10:21 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I keep clicking log in with google but it takes me back to the same page!
23/07/2019, 10:22 - Boyd Kane: I had that last night, it's fine for me now on mobile
23/07/2019, 10:23 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I just tried the subscribe thing as well and it turns out I've just subscribed myself to a newsletter!
23/07/2019, 10:23 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok I tried it with chrome and now it's working
23/07/2019, 10:25 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok I've requested too
23/07/2019, 10:35 - Luc Hayward: done
23/07/2019, 10:38 - Luc Hayward: Stu...I rate we setup my PC at home/an google/azure/aws instance so we can just run as many things as we want?
23/07/2019, 10:38 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: That’s a solid idea 😂
23/07/2019, 10:39 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Also why didn’t we just run things on nightmare last time 🙈
23/07/2019, 10:40 - Luc Hayward: Because nightmare is slow as shit
23/07/2019, 10:40 - Luc Hayward: It's slower than running directly on the lab PC (which is what we did remember we had 4 labs PCs runni things)
23/07/2019, 10:40 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I think it’s a fantastic idea as long as we get it set up and make sure everything is working before the competition starts
23/07/2019, 10:40 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I remember that 😂
23/07/2019, 10:44 - Luc Hayward: Yes yes absolute 😂
23/07/2019, 14:33 - Boyd Kane: Speaking of, could we meet up at some point to chat about the competition and format?
23/07/2019, 17:08 - Luc Hayward: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt3RXhddYME&list=WL&index=86

Interesting VFX take (rather than a cs view)
24/07/2019, 11:42 - Boyd Kane: @27832859563 is the talk by Doc Shock the same as the reinforcement learning one this Friday?
24/07/2019, 11:53 - Luc Hayward: I have no idea, I assume you're seeing that as you walk in the maybe building? I have no clue though I double checked the email and it says Friday, maybe ask him in a lecture
24/07/2019, 12:00 - Luc Hayward: Also yes sounds good
24/07/2019, 14:35 - Boyd Kane: Generally I'm only free from 9-11 and then at meridian, what about you guys?
24/07/2019, 14:56 - Luc Hayward: meridian is the only full overlap unfortunately
24/07/2019, 14:56 - Luc Hayward: stu is free 10-11
24/07/2019, 14:58 - Boyd Kane: And you're not, I assume? If no, then how about tomorrow at 13?
24/07/2019, 15:03 - Luc Hayward: On this friday I am
24/07/2019, 15:03 - Luc Hayward: else tomorrow worjs
24/07/2019, 15:05 - Boyd Kane: @STUWART_THE_MESHATRON_MESHAM does 13h tomorrow work?
24/07/2019, 15:06 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Works for me 👍🏻
24/07/2019, 15:47 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Wait so is the Doc Shock thing definitely not tomorrow at 13h?
24/07/2019, 15:48 - Luc Hayward: No idea 👍
24/07/2019, 15:48 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: 😂
24/07/2019, 15:48 - Luc Hayward: the emails and calendars all say tomorrow
24/07/2019, 15:48 - Luc Hayward: the tv in the maths building says friday in a totally different venue
24/07/2019, 15:48 - Luc Hayward: I think it might be two talks
24/07/2019, 15:49 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Is the Friday one also 1pm?
24/07/2019, 15:49 - Boyd Kane: <Media omitted>
24/07/2019, 15:49 - Luc Hayward: ok
24/07/2019, 15:50 - Luc Hayward: so thats a second talk then separate from the thursday one I believe
24/07/2019, 15:50 - Luc Hayward: probably to prevent the need for a really big venue
24/07/2019, 15:50 - Luc Hayward: its the same one though
24/07/2019, 15:50 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: If there are 2, I can't make the Friday one, because I have a comp sci presentation
24/07/2019, 15:51 - Luc Hayward: yeah I think thursday is better rather
24/07/2019, 15:51 - Luc Hayward: can you come boyd?
25/07/2019, 08:45 - Boyd Kane: I just spoke to the Doc and he said that today's talk is the same as tomorrow's, but probably going to get cancelled since he's not feeling well
25/07/2019, 08:56 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ah ok
25/07/2019, 08:56 - Luc Hayward: He better get better, what time is tomorrow like 1?

03/08/2019, 00:23 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah sorry I’m in Stellies so I’d have to steal Lloyd’s kettle

17/08/2019, 15:04 - Luc Hayward: With jetbrains IDEs, is there a way to have some sort of derived field that only shows up in the debugger? I swear I've had it happen but don't rmemeber when or which language
17/08/2019, 15:04 - Luc Hayward: So like all your fields for your objects can be inspected in the debugger right
17/08/2019, 15:04 - Luc Hayward: But lets say I have some list of attributes
17/08/2019, 15:05 - Luc Hayward: And I have a method getAttributesAsString() that is a member of my class
17/08/2019, 15:05 - Luc Hayward: have you ever had it that you could tell the debugger "hey, always evaluate that method and show it to me as though it were a class variable" ?
17/08/2019, 15:05 - Luc Hayward: Or am I talking shit
17/08/2019, 15:06 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Can’t say I’ve ever done this
17/08/2019, 15:06 - Luc Hayward: I'm sure its a pycharm thing
17/08/2019, 15:26 - Boyd Kane: Yeah you can
17/08/2019, 15:27 - Luc Hayward: Do you know what they call it?

Wanted it for some c++ but the c++ debugger is horrible compared to python and java
17/08/2019, 15:27 - Boyd Kane: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/evaluating-expressions.html
17/08/2019, 15:27 - Boyd Kane: It's like a little calculator button
17/08/2019, 15:29 - Luc Hayward: Thanks, I think what I actually wanted was watches (pycharm lets you create watches for arbitrary expressions)
17/08/2019, 15:29 - Luc Hayward: But thanks it pointed me where I was looking

27/08/2019, 11:55 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I do have (at least most of) the lecture slides in my google drive though
27/08/2019, 11:56 - Boyd Kane: If you could share the drive folder that would be great😊
27/08/2019, 11:56 - Boyd Kane: <Media omitted>
27/08/2019, 11:57 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: You’re welcome 👍🏻
27/08/2019, 11:57 - Boyd Kane: <Media omitted>
27/08/2019, 11:58 - Boyd Kane: I'm watching Aslam explain methods and I'm slowly going crazy
27/08/2019, 11:58 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Wow I forgot just how boring those lectures were 😂😂😂
27/08/2019, 12:00 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: The only one of his lectures I attended was his intro lecture. I don’t think Luc attended a single one. 😂
27/08/2019, 12:05 - Boyd Kane: Sounds appropriate
28/08/2019, 21:15 - Boyd Kane: Hey guys, any idea what the going rate is for tutors? Specifically CSC tutors
28/08/2019, 22:56 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Through UCT was R60/h last I heard. Not sure about privately.
28/08/2019, 23:23 - Luc Hayward: I think it's higher now like 80?
28/08/2019, 23:24 - Luc Hayward: It's not worth it though just tutor privately or I can send your number to a company I used to do some work through too
30/08/2019, 17:31 - Boyd Kane: Okay cheers. I just had a friend ask and was wandering if it'd be worth it
30/08/2019, 17:32 - Boyd Kane: Also, do you guys have any experience in converting 2D pixel locations to relative 3D real world space locations?
30/08/2019, 17:33 - Luc Hayward: As in getting a screenspace coordinate in world space as though you were casting a ray out through the screen?
30/08/2019, 17:33 - Boyd Kane: <Media omitted>
30/08/2019, 17:38 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: That’s the part that’s going to entail all the camera calibration stuff
30/08/2019, 17:38 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html
30/08/2019, 17:40 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: So once we’ve got these properties of the camera we should be able to work these out
30/08/2019, 17:42 - Boyd Kane: But like, how? This seems like it should be a simple matrix multiplication so I tried to work out but I can't
30/08/2019, 17:43 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah read the link it is matrix multiplication
30/08/2019, 17:43 - Boyd Kane: Okay. I'll see how I go
30/08/2019, 17:44 - Luc Hayward: Stu as soon as your camera changes those matrices change hey? If its the same as computer graphics transforms
30/08/2019, 17:44 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Luc knows because he openGLs 🤓
30/08/2019, 17:44 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah
30/08/2019, 17:45 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Like there’s a transformation (matrix) for the camera position, a transformation for the lens distortion etc.
30/08/2019, 17:45 - Luc Hayward: Fuck its asshole
30/08/2019, 17:45 - Luc Hayward: but yes
30/08/2019, 17:46 - Luc Hayward: But I have no idea how to do it backwards in your case
30/08/2019, 17:46 - Luc Hayward: You have some knowledge about the orientation and tilt of the camera
30/08/2019, 17:47 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah this describes how to work them out though
30/08/2019, 17:47 - Luc Hayward: Then yeah there is a way to do it
30/08/2019, 17:47 - Luc Hayward: And it will be super common
30/08/2019, 17:47 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah
30/08/2019, 17:48 - Boyd Kane: I gotta drive but I'll read it and get back to y'all

This is so cool
03/09/2019, 11:58 - Boyd Kane: Is there a way to scrape the resources tab in Vula?
03/09/2019, 12:05 - Luc Hayward: No idea
03/09/2019, 12:06 - Luc Hayward: In theory yes
03/09/2019, 12:08 - Boyd Kane: I'm only hopeful because you've already shown how lackluster they are about security. And I'm sick and tired of manually downloading and sorting out past papers
03/09/2019, 12:09 - Luc Hayward: ok no in that case its honestly faster to just open all the tabs and then cmd+s -> enter to save them all quickly
03/09/2019, 12:09 - Luc Hayward: Cause you need to be signed in to vula
03/09/2019, 12:10 - Boyd Kane: Ughh
03/09/2019, 12:37 - Boyd Kane: But then I'll be manually downloading shirt _for the next 3 years_
03/09/2019, 12:37 - Luc Hayward: yep
03/09/2019, 12:37 - Luc Hayward: enjoy it
03/09/2019, 12:39 - Boyd Kane: I can't believe humanity can manage to send moving pictures of Elon puffing a joint across the world but I can't automate my past papers
03/09/2019, 14:25 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: You can access the resources tab through SMB or something and download the whole folder
03/09/2019, 14:26 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I downloaded the whole resources thing for one of my courses because o was worried they were doing to take past papers down 😂
03/09/2019, 14:29 - Luc Hayward: What how???
03/09/2019, 14:31 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Look in the menus it’s there somewhere 😂
03/09/2019, 14:49 - Boyd Kane: Did you go to Resources>transfer files?
03/09/2019, 14:49 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I think so
03/09/2019, 14:49 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I don’t have my laptop out at the moment
03/09/2019, 14:50 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Then there was something where I used connect to server on finder
03/09/2019, 14:50 - Boyd Kane: And then used your UCT password? It seems hopeful but it keeps on rejecting my password
03/09/2019, 14:50 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: May have had to add smb:// to the start of the url
03/09/2019, 14:50 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah
03/09/2019, 14:50 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Maybe your username with @wf.uct etc
03/09/2019, 14:51 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: MSHSTU001@wf.uct.ac.za
03/09/2019, 14:51 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Try that if your normal username and normal UCT email don’t work
03/09/2019, 14:54 - Boyd Kane: Bingo
03/09/2019, 14:54 - Boyd Kane: KNXBOY001, UCT password, and then the URL is just straight up copied from the https one they give you

06/09/2019, 15:26 - Luc Hayward: We missed data structures last week
06/09/2019, 15:26 - Luc Hayward: But @27722193705 remember strings maths and graphs were there ones we struggled most with
06/09/2019, 15:59 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: But but can’t we just get some practice problems and solutions?

19/09/2019, 23:34 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Anyone keen for the Allan Gray Hackathon? (12+13 October)
20/09/2019, 07:04 - Luc Hayward: What's the rewards potential?
20/09/2019, 08:49 - Boyd Kane: And the times?
20/09/2019, 08:52 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Top three teams win “a cash prize” 🤦🏻‍♂😂
20/09/2019, 08:53 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Haven’t given any times they say it’s a 24 hour thing though

Pretty amazing
25/09/2019, 11:37 - Luc Hayward: https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/
25/09/2019, 11:50 - Boyd Kane: Honestly I love that someone spent time and energy to code in dynamic smiley faces onto them😂
25/09/2019, 11:51 - Luc Hayward: Yeah I've been trying to find and understand how the visualisations are done but I'm really struggling
25/09/2019, 11:52 - Luc Hayward: Cause they're using mujoco for the world generation which is a python library that OpenAI use a lot....but it doesn't produce anywhere near this level of quality
25/09/2019, 11:52 - Luc Hayward: I mean that looks like unity to me
25/09/2019, 11:52 - Luc Hayward: But they don't mention that anywhere in the write up
25/09/2019, 12:03 - Luc Hayward: Got the paper to load finally
25/09/2019, 12:20 - Luc Hayward: The environment is simulated in MUJOCO physics engine.
Simulating the agents as speres with observations of position, velocity and size of objects and other agents.
They can choose from 3 actions simultaneously at teach time step: move(apply force along x/y axis and torque on the z), grab/not grab an object which binds the agent to the closest object, lock/not lock an object in place which can then only be unlocked by the same team.
25/09/2019, 12:26 - Luc Hayward: OK I give up, I can't find anything on how they're transferring the simulations from MUJOCO to presumably unity/unreal
25/09/2019, 12:50 - Boyd Kane: Maybe the academics just used Mujoco and then they handed it over to a graphics team to make it all pretty for the public
25/09/2019, 12:51 - Boyd Kane: So that people don't realise this is analogous to robots seek-and-destroy on the battlefield😂🙈
25/09/2019, 13:03 - Luc Hayward: Maybe but like... The visualisations are in the actual paper? So they were done before the paper was published.
25/09/2019, 15:40 - Boyd Kane: 🤷🏻‍♂
25/09/2019, 21:05 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>

29/09/2019, 21:07 - Luc Hayward: Either of you watch today's smarter everyday episode on gun detection?
29/09/2019, 21:08 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: No?
29/09/2019, 21:09 - Luc Hayward: Do you.... Know what I'm talking about Stu? 😂
29/09/2019, 21:09 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: His name is Destin? 😂
29/09/2019, 21:11 - Luc Hayward: Yes😂😂
29/09/2019, 21:11 - Luc Hayward: Tldr some friend of his made an image classifier that can be used (attached to a video feed) to monitor for guns and send an alert email/sms to whoever about it
29/09/2019, 21:11 - Luc Hayward: But specifically designed only to detect guns being held ? So not if they're holstered
29/09/2019, 21:11 - Luc Hayward: Something like 30k training samples most of which were hand labelled
29/09/2019, 21:23 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Sounds... familiar 😂
29/09/2019, 21:23 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: That’s really cool though
29/09/2019, 21:46 - Boyd Kane: Very cool video.

Because stu will complain about the weird link
03/10/2019, 09:05 - Boyd Kane: Hey all, would you recommend doing INF in second year or in third year?
03/10/2019, 09:06 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Well if you can, I’d recommend trying to fabricate a clash with stats in both 2nd and 3rd year and doing the concession test instead. 10/10 fantastic experience 👌🏻
03/10/2019, 09:07 - Boyd Kane: 😂
03/10/2019, 09:20 - Luc Hayward: You have to do info's for one semester
03/10/2019, 09:20 - Luc Hayward: 1000000% this
03/10/2019, 09:21 - Luc Hayward: But chat to Faith, she did infos the whole way through
03/10/2019, 09:21 - Luc Hayward: .... actually wait you don't know faith do you 😂
03/10/2019, 09:21 - Luc Hayward: Do your very best to not take infos more than is absolutely necessary
03/10/2019, 09:23 - Boyd Kane: I think I bumped into her at a party about 3 years ago, so yeah😄🙈
03/10/2019, 09:23 - Boyd Kane: What do you mean? Isn't it just a semester and then it's done?
03/10/2019, 09:23 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: 😂😂
03/10/2019, 09:23 - Boyd Kane: Stu teach me your ways
03/10/2019, 09:24 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I hear it was a long semester 😂
03/10/2019, 10:05 - Luc Hayward: Yeah but you asked....oh I totally misread your question. Take infos in second year 100% I think. It's such a waste of your time in third year
03/10/2019, 10:06 - Boyd Kane: Okay, so you don't think it's worth the risk to try and pull a Stuart?
03/10/2019, 10:07 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Arrange it now though then there’s no risk 😂
03/10/2019, 10:07 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Go tell them about how stats + Spanish clash with infos both years and ask them to sign the forms so they can’t go back on it 😆
03/10/2019, 10:08 - Luc Hayward: Yeah no you have to arrange it in advance
03/10/2019, 10:08 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I’ll send you the forms you need
03/10/2019, 10:09 - Luc Hayward: You can't just not register and then in third year be like "woops my bad". In fact I don't even think they'll let you register without querying it 😂
03/10/2019, 10:12 - Boyd Kane: I went to Aslam to talk about my Spanish, and he basically said to get good grades this year, register Spanish as a third major next year and if there's a clash with INF I should then tell them to make a plan😅
03/10/2019, 10:12 - Boyd Kane: Thanks Stu
04/10/2019, 22:33 - Luc Hayward: Eyyy ok mainly @27722193705  but boyd you'll like this
04/10/2019, 22:33 - Luc Hayward: If I give you a syringe with a valve on the end
04/10/2019, 22:34 - Luc Hayward: and I give you a scale (like a nice chemistry one)
04/10/2019, 22:34 - Luc Hayward: You could give me the mass and it would be easy
04/10/2019, 22:35 - Luc Hayward: Now what would you say the scale would read if I closed the valve on the syringe, pulled the plunger all the way back and then locked the plunger there (so that is stayed pulled up)
04/10/2019, 22:36 - Luc Hayward: Would the scale read:
A) lighter
B) the same
or C) heavier
04/10/2019, 22:36 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Woah where did this question come from? 😂
04/10/2019, 22:36 - Luc Hayward: Shhh just guess
04/10/2019, 22:36 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok option A 😂
04/10/2019, 22:36 - Luc Hayward: Ah but do you know why>
04/10/2019, 22:37 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Buoyancy?

04/10/2019, 22:38 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Heyyyyyyy 🎉 😎😂
04/10/2019, 22:38 - Luc Hayward: the syringe is now slightly lighter than before because its like an ultra effective helium balloon
04/10/2019, 22:38 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Trippy thought for today 😂

04/10/2019, 22:41 - Luc Hayward: I think I'm halfway through haha
04/10/2019, 22:42 - Luc Hayward: He couldn't find any real examples of balls that actually had sf6 in them beyond a patent for it

12/10/2019, 22:49 - Luc Hayward: So kipchoge (the marathon guy) broke the 2 hour marathon today
12/10/2019, 22:49 - Luc Hayward: 5.84m/s on average
12/10/2019, 22:49 - Luc Hayward: 100m in 17s 42 times in a row
12/10/2019, 22:49 - Luc Hayward: Thought that may be of interest as you both run
12/10/2019, 22:50 - Luc Hayward: I don't think I could keep that pace up for even 50m on a treadmill
12/10/2019, 23:04 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I also saw that. It’s unbelievable 😂 he did a marathon at my sprinting speed
12/10/2019, 23:05 - Luc Hayward: You sprint at 21km/h?
12/10/2019, 23:08 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: I think? How fast do you sprint? 😂
12/10/2019, 23:08 - Luc Hayward: I dunno but that's fast as fuck
12/10/2019, 23:09 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Then probably not 😂 it’s somewhere around 19/20 though
12/10/2019, 23:10 - Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/Ds21U7coQzI

3 minutes into this
12/10/2019, 23:11 - Luc Hayward: Ok so I forgot I watch everything at 2x speed
12/10/2019, 23:11 - Luc Hayward: Still 21km/h for 2 hours is insane
12/10/2019, 23:11 - Luc Hayward: Like that's proper fasr
12/10/2019, 23:14 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Woah yeah that does look intense
13/10/2019, 08:03 - Luc Hayward: Next time you go for a run try run at 21km/h.
13/10/2019, 08:03 - Luc Hayward: That would be full sprint for me

13/10/2019, 09:22 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yep 😂
13/10/2019, 12:20 - Luc Hayward: https://github.com/beyarkay/EntellectChallenge2019

Are we planning to clean this up and make it public
13/10/2019, 12:50 - Boyd Kane: Yeah I think so, I had totally forgotten about it to be honest😂
13/10/2019, 13:04 - Luc Hayward: Just needs a readme and then it's good enough I think
13/10/2019, 17:27 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
13/10/2019, 17:28 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: ok ok 😂😂😂
13/10/2019, 18:35 - Boyd Kane: <Media omitted>
13/10/2019, 18:43 - Luc Hayward: looks like Deep ocean material theme

13/10/2019, 18:55 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Ok I’m changing because I want to be like batman not because you said so
13/10/2019, 19:00 - Boyd Kane: <Media omitted>
13/10/2019, 20:01 - Luc Hayward: A question for you
13/10/2019, 20:01 - Luc Hayward: Could you feasibly run a torrent box on a raspberry Pi (or similar)
13/10/2019, 20:01 - Luc Hayward: Rather than having your main PC drawing a shit ton of power
13/10/2019, 20:01 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Yeah 👍🏻
13/10/2019, 20:02 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Now you want one?
13/10/2019, 20:03 - Luc Hayward: It just feels wasteful to run a desktop overnight but no I don't really torrent enough to make it worthwhile 😂
14/10/2019, 18:38 - Luc Hayward: This message was deleted
14/10/2019, 18:57 - Luc Hayward: Added a super simple readme
14/10/2019, 19:04 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Thanks! Can you make it public too please
14/10/2019, 19:04 - Luc Hayward: its Boyds
14/10/2019, 19:04 - Stuart "Stew" Mesham: Oh
14/10/2019, 19:53 - Boyd Kane: Ah sorry, it's public now
14/10/2019, 20:09 - Luc Hayward: 👌
15/10/2019, 18:26 - Boyd Kane: <Media omitted>
15/10/2019, 18:26 - Luc Hayward: 😂😂😂
15/10/2019, 18:27 - Luc Hayward: Gotta be honest in your work
15/10/2019, 19:02 - Boyd Kane: <Media omitted>
15/10/2019, 19:03 - Luc Hayward: Oh so you do have a maximum size that your github account can use up I think
15/10/2019, 19:03 - Luc Hayward: yeah you need to use LFS (its super simple)
15/10/2019, 19:03 - Boyd Kane: So splitting them up isn't going to make it any better?
15/10/2019, 19:03 - Boyd Kane: What's this?
15/10/2019, 19:03 - Luc Hayward: it will here
15/10/2019, 19:04 - Luc Hayward: it stands for git large file system
15/10/2019, 19:04 - Luc Hayward: its actually intended for large binary files
15/10/2019, 19:04 - Luc Hayward: But it will work fine for any large file
15/10/2019, 19:04 - Luc Hayward: Basically instead of putting a massive file into the git history it stores a reference to that file (I believe)
15/10/2019, 19:05 - Luc Hayward: And then stores the big file on its own
15/10/2019, 19:05 - Luc Hayward: Really really easy to set up though
15/10/2019, 19:05 - Luc Hayward: You do have a 1.5GB limit I think on github though?
15/10/2019, 19:05 - Boyd Kane: No limit, just a limit on single files
15/10/2019, 19:05 - Luc Hayward: https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage

everything you could want to know
15/10/2019, 19:06 - Luc Hayward: there definitely is a limit with github tied to your account
15/10/2019, 19:07 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
15/10/2019, 19:07 - Boyd Kane: That's for LFS, but I don't think there's a limit for normal
15/10/2019, 19:07 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
15/10/2019, 19:07 - Luc Hayward: oh no I don't believe there is
15/10/2019, 19:09 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
15/10/2019, 19:09 - Boyd Kane: WhatsApp*?
15/10/2019, 19:14 - Luc Hayward: yeah
15/10/2019, 19:15 - Luc Hayward: Like that 100% isn't helpful to you
15/10/2019, 19:15 - Boyd Kane: Aww
15/10/2019, 19:16 - Luc Hayward: I don't even think it runs
15/10/2019, 19:16 - Luc Hayward: <Media omitted>
15/10/2019, 19:17 - Boyd Kane: Okay, I'll figure something else out
