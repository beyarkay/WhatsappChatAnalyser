[2017/01/26, 14:32:18] Stuart Mesham: The game was so cool
[2017/01/26, 14:32:32] Luc Hayward: that's all in 2 days
[2017/01/26, 14:32:34] Luc Hayward: everything
[2017/01/26, 14:32:41] Luc Hayward: art programming all
[2017/01/26, 14:32:44] Stuart Mesham: Though I get the feeling it's way above our level 😂
[2017/01/26, 14:33:00] Luc Hayward: only the art really
[2017/01/26, 14:33:01] Stuart Mesham: They must've been really good
[2017/01/26, 14:33:16] Luc Hayward: timeframe yeah of course
[2017/01/26, 14:33:39] Stuart Mesham: The shockwaves must've been pretty missiony to make
[2017/01/26, 14:34:06] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'm sure it would take us a whole week or more 😂
[2017/01/26, 14:35:16] Luc Hayward: i think quite a bit more
[2017/01/26, 14:35:36] Luc Hayward: so basically ech of those blocks is its own object and he's just applying an upwards force
[2017/01/26, 14:35:56] Luc Hayward: still working on this tetris thing on and off
[2017/01/26, 14:37:44] Luc Hayward: but it's only worthwhile on tablets (or pc if i added buttons to rotate the screen)
[2017/01/26, 14:38:22] Luc Hayward: because of the square play area
[2017/01/26, 14:41:52] Stuart Mesham: Can you send me an APK of what it is at the moment?
[2017/01/26, 14:42:03] Stuart Mesham: I wanna try it 😄
[2017/01/26, 14:42:17] Stuart Mesham: I'll use my Nexus 7
[2017/01/26, 14:44:33] Luc Hayward: I'll send it when It's playable
[2017/01/26, 14:45:04] Luc Hayward: reworking the whole system atm
[2017/01/26, 14:45:05] Stuart Mesham: You can't even test it at the moment?
[2017/01/26, 14:45:09] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/01/26, 14:45:31] Luc Hayward: been playing too much ow
[2017/01/26, 14:45:48] Stuart Mesham: How does the Tetris-y system work?
[2017/01/26, 14:46:15] Stuart Mesham: Like making rows disappear
[2017/01/26, 14:46:27] Stuart Mesham: Or is that the hard part
[2017/01/26, 14:47:18] Luc Hayward: that's actually pretty easy
[2017/01/26, 14:47:38] Stuart Mesham: Random question, did you ever play not Tetris? 😄
[2017/01/26, 14:48:07] Luc Hayward: yep

[2017/01/26, 14:48:16] Luc Hayward: and ill call tomorrow to explain?
[2017/01/26, 14:48:42] Luc Hayward: like how the tetris stuff works
[2017/01/26, 14:57:06] Stuart Mesham: The mashy physics one
[2017/01/26, 14:57:48] Stuart Mesham: Just show me sometime

[2017/01/26, 15:01:43] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/01/26, 15:50:00] Luc Hayward: I'm lost in my own code and it's kiling me
[2017/01/26, 16:07:34] Stuart Mesham: Shame, I know the feels 😂
[2017/01/26, 16:08:02] Luc Hayward: I literally have no idea what's triggering my endgame state
[2017/01/26, 16:08:29] Luc Hayward: Like i know why it's triggering and it is triggering correctly
[2017/01/26, 16:08:31] Luc Hayward: i just dno why
[2017/01/26, 16:09:54] Stuart Mesham: Me neither \_(ツ)_/¯

[2017/01/26, 16:14:20] Stuart Mesham: That's cool
[2017/01/26, 16:50:43] Luc Hayward: ugh visual studio died
[2017/01/26, 16:50:53] Luc Hayward: been reparing it since 4
[2017/01/26, 16:54:02] Stuart Mesham: Shame man
[2017/01/26, 16:54:30] Stuart Mesham: https://youtu.be/Sagg08DrO5U
[2017/01/26, 16:54:46] Stuart Mesham: Just watch this while it reboots
[2017/01/26, 16:55:21] Luc Hayward: the intellisense section keeps throwing erros
[2017/01/26, 16:55:34] Luc Hayward: as soon as you create an error it crashes the program
[2017/01/26, 16:56:07] Stuart Mesham: Soz bro
[2017/01/26, 16:56:27] Luc Hayward: its fine
[2017/01/26, 16:56:32] Luc Hayward: if it wont repair itself i redownload
[2017/01/26, 16:57:08] Stuart Mesham: Watch the video, really 😄
[2017/01/26, 16:57:26] Luc Hayward: i shall

[2017/01/26, 17:54:49] Stuart Mesham: Ouch
[2017/01/26, 17:55:01] Luc Hayward: Fixed thiugh
[2017/01/27, 07:41:34] Luc Hayward: We created a VR game that uses motion to move instead of a controller - it's called Jogger
https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5qcc6k/we_created_a_vr_game_that_uses_motion_to_move/?st=IYFDS07X&sh=b057b461

[2017/01/27, 08:53:15] Stuart Mesham: Like Crossy road for Google cardboard but better
[2017/01/27, 09:26:09] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/01/27, 19:25:15] Luc Hayward: Im busy implementing the rotation code
[2017/01/27, 19:25:41] Luc Hayward: Hoping I can do it in like 30 lines by just changing the way the programme views down
[2017/01/27, 19:27:54] Luc Hayward: Think I need to tweak the size of the play fields
[2017/01/27, 19:30:00] Luc Hayward: Using you as a to-do list cus I'm out and brainstorming
[2017/01/27, 19:30:24] Luc Hayward: For rotation change the programs direction variables
[2017/01/27, 19:31:28] Luc Hayward: For removing rows, add a value to a new script on the terminology that maintains a record of which direction the blocks should move so that blocks on one side aren't shifted down when the opposite side clears a row
[2017/01/27, 20:00:43] Stuart Mesham: Oh no I'm a to-do list 😒
[2017/01/27, 20:04:58] Luc Hayward: Thanks Stu. 😂😂
[2017/01/27, 20:05:15] Luc Hayward: But yeah fully playable minus any actual rotation features
[2017/01/27, 20:06:05] Stuart Mesham: Awesome, well done
[2017/01/27, 20:06:56] Luc Hayward: Which means right now it's boring Tetris without ui

[2017/01/30, 12:32:13] Stuart Mesham: The Bishy crew's being indecisive about whether or not we're doing something today so I might be free today
[2017/01/30, 12:32:45] Luc Hayward: 😂 is it only Lloyd who's at Stellenbosch?
[2017/01/30, 12:41:43] Stuart Mesham: Yeah just Lloyd
[2017/01/30, 12:45:43] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/01/30, 13:08:33] Stuart Mesham: Still no decision so do you want to just come chill for the rest of the day?
[2017/01/30, 13:47:48] Luc Hayward: got work to do for my mom today.....
[2017/01/30, 13:48:04] Luc Hayward: probably can't come till atleast 4 shall we reschedule rather to like tomorrow or somethign?
[2017/01/30, 14:04:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah not worth it today then
[2017/01/30, 14:04:59] Luc Hayward: nah
[2017/01/30, 14:05:03] Luc Hayward: but another day?
[2017/01/30, 14:05:55] Stuart Mesham: My weeks plan is pretty uncertain so arranging on the day is gonna work best for me 🙈
[2017/01/30, 14:06:27] Luc Hayward: surely if it's uncertain that means free everyday currently...?
[2017/01/30, 14:07:31] Stuart Mesham: Nah holiday work and driving lessons are being planned at the moment just not much actually confirmed
[2017/01/30, 14:07:45] Luc Hayward: holiday work?
[2017/01/30, 14:08:00] Luc Hayward: well make tentative plans and confirm on the day?
[2017/01/30, 14:08:46] Stuart Mesham: Yeah my dad is arranging with one of his friends for me to do a week at his work (some IT related stuff)
[2017/01/30, 14:08:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah tomorrow? 😄
[2017/01/30, 14:09:02] Luc Hayward: ah ok that's cool?
[2017/01/30, 14:09:16] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 👍🏻
[2017/01/30, 14:09:38] Stuart Mesham: The work is helping him setup a new part of a vehicle tracking system
[2017/01/30, 14:09:52] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/01/30, 14:09:55] Luc Hayward: seems pretty easy?
[2017/01/30, 14:10:05] Stuart Mesham: They've got a new tracker and need to set up their server and the device to work with it
[2017/01/30, 14:10:14] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/01/30, 14:10:47] Stuart Mesham: It seems easy but then I started looking at the manual and it's quite long so idk 😂
[2017/01/30, 14:12:00] Stuart Mesham: I'm sure it's not gonna be too complicated though
[2017/01/30, 14:12:33] Luc Hayward: It really shouldn't be too bad
[2017/01/30, 14:12:46] Luc Hayward: wont take you a week i hope

[2017/02/01, 10:53:31] Stuart Mesham: That's useless
[2017/02/01, 11:33:44] Luc Hayward: Go after and stay over or nah?
[2017/02/01, 12:56:59] Luc Hayward: Also please can you upload the scripts and stuff ?
[2017/02/01, 13:15:35] Stuart Mesham: I really want to because I'm not doing anything today but I'm not sure whether Chris will be social-ed out after the movies
[2017/02/01, 13:15:45] Stuart Mesham: Will do that now
[2017/02/01, 13:15:54] Luc Hayward: Ask him? Just call the housr
[2017/02/01, 13:16:07] Stuart Mesham: Just make a backup in case it messes _everything_ up
[2017/02/01, 13:16:55] Stuart Mesham: Add him back to the don't leave group 😄
[2017/02/01, 13:17:10] Luc Hayward: He won't read it
[2017/02/01, 13:17:10] Stuart Mesham: Then ask him before he leaves 😄
[2017/02/01, 13:17:13] Luc Hayward: Yeah I did
[2017/02/01, 13:17:19] Luc Hayward: He wont
[2017/02/01, 13:17:23] Luc Hayward: Just call him and tell me
[2017/02/01, 13:17:40] Stuart Mesham: No you didn't 😂
[2017/02/01, 13:17:54] Luc Hayward: I made a backup I mean
[2017/02/01, 13:17:58] Stuart Mesham: There's nothing in the group
[2017/02/01, 13:17:59] Stuart Mesham: Oh

[2017/02/01, 13:23:35] Stuart Mesham: I don't think he wants us 🙈😂
[2017/02/01, 13:31:49] Luc Hayward: It's at 2
[2017/02/01, 13:34:01] Stuart Mesham: Nice 👌🏻😄

[2017/02/01, 14:55:56] Stuart Mesham: Idk depends on Chris?
[2017/02/01, 14:56:34] Luc Hayward: Which we won't know till much later I presume
[2017/02/01, 14:57:16] Stuart Mesham: Probably only when he comes out of the movie
[2017/02/01, 14:57:34] Luc Hayward: Dno when that will be
[2017/02/01, 14:57:42] Stuart Mesham: Me neither 🙈😄
[2017/02/01, 15:06:05] Luc Hayward: 😂 by 5i believe
[2017/02/01, 15:54:16] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I hope so
[2017/02/01, 15:54:53] Luc Hayward: I'm keen
[2017/02/01, 15:55:29] Stuart Mesham: Me too
[2017/02/01, 15:55:38] Stuart Mesham: And guess what?
[2017/02/01, 15:55:53] Stuart Mesham: I found a version of offworld that actually works! 🎉
[2017/02/01, 15:55:55] Luc Hayward: I dno
[2017/02/01, 15:55:59] Luc Hayward: What!!
[2017/02/01, 15:56:02] Luc Hayward: Really????
[2017/02/01, 15:56:01] Stuart Mesham: I just tested it
[2017/02/01, 15:56:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah!
[2017/02/01, 15:56:15] Luc Hayward: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[2017/02/01, 15:56:33] Stuart Mesham: Ever more keen for this evening 👌🏻😄
[2017/02/01, 15:57:04] Luc Hayward: That, that new game you find, planetary and offworld
[2017/02/01, 15:57:17] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/02/01, 15:58:00] Luc Hayward: I'm assuming we are just gonna be fine to arrive at like 5/5:30
[2017/02/01, 15:59:12] Stuart Mesham: I feel like he might not be there
[2017/02/01, 16:00:08] Luc Hayward: I know
[2017/02/01, 16:00:12] Stuart Mesham: I think his movie actually ends at 5 so I'd aim for 5:30
[2017/02/01, 16:00:18] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/02/01, 16:00:47] Stuart Mesham: Or just camp at my house until he gets home 😄
[2017/02/01, 16:01:31] Stuart Mesham: Do you want to come to mine at 5 actually?
[2017/02/01, 16:01:42] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/02/01, 16:01:54] Luc Hayward: I'll shower and hear through between 4:30 and 5
[2017/02/01, 16:02:33] Stuart Mesham: Ok tell me when you're on your way 👍🏻
[2017/02/01, 16:02:43] Luc Hayward: Sounds good
[2017/02/01, 16:59:18] Luc Hayward: On my way

[2017/02/01, 17:20:25] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/02/04, 08:14:46] Luc Hayward: Hey man
[2017/02/04, 08:17:02] Luc Hayward: I dno if you looked at our course outline and at how many credits we need over the 3 years?
[2017/02/04, 08:18:17] Luc Hayward: I assume we can take electives outside of the courses required by our majors in order to make up the rest of our credits?
[2017/02/04, 18:27:07] Luc Hayward: aight so i checked up on it and now i made sure that atleast the way that the grid looks on the screen is the same as what the grid represents programatically
[2017/02/05, 13:54:48] Luc Hayward: Make an unusual hockey game they said
https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/5s5kwi/make_an_unusual_hockey_game_they_said/?st=IYSM2N6T&sh=902bf1ec
[2017/02/05, 14:03:43] Stuart Mesham: Haven't checked the course outline yet, maybe I should do that today 🤔
[2017/02/05, 14:04:52] Stuart Mesham: 😂😂😂 I need this game
[2017/02/05, 14:10:25] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/02/05, 14:12:14] Luc Hayward: Genetics comes to 306 credits so no matter what you do you'll always be doing a double major or a ton of electives???
[2017/02/05, 14:42:04] Stuart Mesham: You seeing this in the science faculty handbook?
[2017/02/05, 14:58:33] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/02/05, 14:58:45] Luc Hayward: https://www.uct.ac.za/usr/apply/handbooks/2017/SCI_2017.pdf
[2017/02/06, 16:14:21] Luc Hayward: Sup
[2017/02/06, 19:12:30] Luc Hayward: Check unity I started tonight on writing code for clearing rows correctly
[2017/02/06, 19:13:15] Luc Hayward: Using the z axis of the grid to store the sides (0-3) with 0 default
[2017/02/06, 20:03:56] Stuart Mesham: Will check now 👌🏻
[2017/02/06, 20:44:34] Luc Hayward: It's so disjointed I dno you'll follow it at all
[2017/02/06, 21:06:37] Stuart Mesham: I think this is the point
[2017/02/06, 21:06:57] Luc Hayward: Ah right
[2017/02/06, 21:07:09] Luc Hayward: Are you still planning to register for genetics
[2017/02/06, 21:07:13] Stuart Mesham: If I carry on with everything then I major in both
[2017/02/06, 21:07:17] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/02/06, 21:07:25] Luc Hayward: Yeah I reread it
[2017/02/06, 21:07:38] Stuart Mesham: Just looking at it now
[2017/02/06, 21:10:30] Luc Hayward: You have to structure a syllabus that results in 120 third year credits somehow
[2017/02/06, 21:10:35] Luc Hayward: That's how they decide
[2017/02/06, 21:12:08] Luc Hayward: And every major has at least 60
[2017/02/06, 21:12:10] Luc Hayward: But yeah
[2017/02/06, 21:12:39] Luc Hayward: So genetics ?
[2017/02/06, 21:12:42] Luc Hayward: Why?
[2017/02/06, 21:14:34] Luc Hayward: Just curious
[2017/02/06, 21:50:11] Stuart Mesham: Just because I'm interested
[2017/02/06, 21:51:18] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/02/06, 21:54:10] Luc Hayward: How do they solve conflicts
[2017/02/06, 21:54:37] Luc Hayward: Like how do we make sure that comp sci courses aren't in the same time as genetics or something
[2017/02/06, 21:55:14] Luc Hayward: And what about majors that both have say maths 1000
[2017/02/06, 21:58:49] Luc Hayward: For instance if you do comp sci with any of the three majors that require your first major to be comp sci, all 4 majors have the exact same first years courses .....
[2017/02/07, 11:52:05] Stuart Mesham: For this the maths 1000 just counts towards both majors
[2017/02/07, 11:54:37] Stuart Mesham: I think if your majors have too many overlapping courses then you just have to do some electives
[2017/02/07, 11:55:13] Stuart Mesham: To get to the 120 credits
[2017/02/07, 11:55:43] Stuart Mesham: To get a BSc
[2017/02/07, 12:33:56] Luc Hayward: Like you're taking genetics and comp sci
[2017/02/07, 12:34:05] Luc Hayward: So what happens if your lectures clash?
[2017/02/07, 12:34:10] Luc Hayward: Or do they make sure they dont
[2017/02/07, 14:30:03] Stuart Mesham: I'm not actually sure how that works
[2017/02/07, 14:31:03] Stuart Mesham: Dan says for most of the major courses they do the same lecture multiple times a day
[2017/02/07, 14:32:12] Luc Hayward: Ok so I relooked
[2017/02/07, 14:32:38] Luc Hayward: The handbook is *ONLY* compulsory modules. So there are all the electives
[2017/02/07, 14:36:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that must be where extra credits come from
[2017/02/07, 14:36:18] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/02/07, 14:36:30] Luc Hayward: So I'm stuck I dno what I'm gonna go for
[2017/02/08, 10:17:48] Stuart Mesham: Don't you have enough credits?
[2017/02/08, 10:18:09] Luc Hayward: No I mean I don't know what to take as a second major
[2017/02/08, 10:18:30] Luc Hayward: No everyone ends up at enough credits after electives it's impossible not to unless youre a real retard
[2017/02/08, 10:19:17] Stuart Mesham: Oh do genetics 😂
[2017/02/08, 10:19:38] Luc Hayward: Still Kinda wanna take game Dev.
[2017/02/08, 10:19:40] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/02/08, 10:20:18] Stuart Mesham: Are you unsure about it now?
[2017/02/08, 10:20:56] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/02/08, 10:23:26] Stuart Mesham: Just do it if you want to
[2017/02/08, 10:24:01] Stuart Mesham: That's all the "careful planning" that went into my choices 🙈
[2017/02/08, 10:24:38] Luc Hayward: 😂 why do you want to do genetics
[2017/02/08, 10:24:45] Luc Hayward: Genetics seems cool but chemistry
[2017/02/08, 10:27:21] Luc Hayward: Also I end up at 306 credits (cus there are a lot of shared courses) whereas you end up at 306 just from genetics
[2017/02/08, 10:49:29] Stuart Mesham: Because I'm interested
[2017/02/08, 10:52:03] Luc Hayward: So am i
[2017/02/08, 10:52:12] Luc Hayward: Unfortunately I'm interested in a lot of shit

[2017/02/09, 16:15:55] Stuart Mesham: The android app
[2017/02/09, 16:16:23] Stuart Mesham: Today I started an iOS version
[2017/02/09, 16:16:41] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>

[2017/02/09, 16:17:26] Stuart Mesham: The server was probably off when you looked at it 😂
[2017/02/09, 16:17:45] Stuart Mesham: In swift
[2017/02/09, 16:17:59] Stuart Mesham: Swift is actually quite good
[2017/02/09, 16:18:51] Stuart Mesham: It's hard typed like Java but you have to do very little typing like in python
[2017/02/09, 16:18:58] Stuart Mesham: It's the best of both worlds
[2017/02/09, 16:19:00] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/02/09, 16:19:41] Luc Hayward: You mean statically typed ? Ie not dynamic typing
[2017/02/09, 16:19:59] Stuart Mesham: Quite the to-do list you go there
[2017/02/09, 16:20:02] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/02/09, 16:20:06] Stuart Mesham: Static typing
[2017/02/09, 16:20:12] Luc Hayward: Yea
[2017/02/09, 16:20:18] Luc Hayward: Well priorities right
[2017/02/09, 16:20:31] Stuart Mesham: I hate dynamic typing 😂
[2017/02/09, 16:20:51] Luc Hayward: Obviously going to learn swift else why would I get a mac
[2017/02/09, 16:21:05] Luc Hayward: Just Low down the priority list
[2017/02/09, 16:21:06] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah remember that reason 😄
[2017/02/09, 16:21:28] Stuart Mesham: Have you started doing any python?
[2017/02/09, 16:21:42] Luc Hayward: Nah
[2017/02/09, 16:21:53] Luc Hayward: You said it was easy
[2017/02/09, 16:22:01] Stuart Mesham: It is quite
[2017/02/09, 16:22:17] Stuart Mesham: It shouldn't take long to get going with it
[2017/02/09, 16:22:49] Stuart Mesham: Are you winning with the Tetris?
[2017/02/09, 16:26:26] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/02/09, 16:27:00] Luc Hayward: Had to start changing back to tags rather than a third value in the array though because it was causing me a lot of problems with array index errors
[2017/02/10, 11:01:57] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/02/10, 12:14:39] Luc Hayward: Rob left and I can't keep going till he gets back😒
[2017/02/10, 13:13:15] Stuart Mesham: Having fun sitting in his office?
[2017/02/10, 13:13:49] Luc Hayward: Finishing up the last of what I'm happy to do without checking then going home
[2017/02/10, 13:14:02] Luc Hayward: Note gonna waste my time and his money
[2017/02/10, 13:14:20] Stuart Mesham: Good thinking 👍🏻
[2017/02/10, 13:14:37] Stuart Mesham: Our water pressure's gone
[2017/02/10, 13:14:52] Stuart Mesham: There's a bust pipe down the road 😬
[2017/02/10, 13:15:04] Stuart Mesham: No shower for me 😪
[2017/02/10, 13:15:36] Luc Hayward: Lol shit
[2017/02/10, 13:15:39] Luc Hayward: That sucks
[2017/02/10, 13:16:02] Luc Hayward: Why would you be showering at this time of day😂
[2017/02/10, 14:07:55] Stuart Mesham: No when I woke up
[2017/02/10, 14:08:39] Stuart Mesham: Still greasy 😖
[2017/02/15, 07:36:49] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>

[2017/02/16, 13:48:33] Stuart Mesham: Haha join uuuus 😄
[2017/02/16, 13:48:48] Luc Hayward: it looks so cool !
[2017/02/16, 13:48:59] Luc Hayward: I cant play cus I'm in knysna without my pc
[2017/02/16, 13:49:00] Stuart Mesham: It does look good
[2017/02/16, 13:49:13] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/02/16, 13:49:22] Stuart Mesham: I'll give it a try
[2017/02/16, 14:36:22] Luc Hayward: check life goes on
[2017/02/16, 16:37:55] Luc Hayward: on itch.io
[2017/02/16, 18:21:23] Stuart Mesham: I can't seem to find it
[2017/02/16, 18:21:32] Luc Hayward: I'll send you a link
[2017/02/16, 18:33:49] Luc Hayward: Ok go to itch.io
[2017/02/16, 18:34:03] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/02/16, 18:34:10] Luc Hayward: And search life goes on
[2017/02/16, 18:34:19] Luc Hayward: Or just go to all games
[2017/02/16, 18:34:18] Stuart Mesham: I did!
[2017/02/16, 18:35:10] Stuart Mesham: Turtle simulator is the first result
[2017/02/16, 18:35:31] Stuart Mesham: https://itch.io/search?q=life+goes+on
[2017/02/16, 18:36:43] Luc Hayward: Then set filters as mac, free and top of all time
[2017/02/16, 18:36:46] Luc Hayward: Should come up then
[2017/02/16, 18:37:36] Stuart Mesham: Still no
[2017/02/16, 18:37:51] Stuart Mesham: Send me a link
[2017/02/16, 18:38:05] Stuart Mesham: https://itch.io/games/platform-osx
[2017/02/16, 18:39:51] Luc Hayward: http://www.lifegoesongame.com
[2017/02/16, 18:39:57] Luc Hayward: Can't find it on mobile
[2017/02/16, 18:42:37] Stuart Mesham: NO WAY! IT LOOKS SO GOOD! 😂
[2017/02/16, 18:43:25] Luc Hayward: Right ?
[2017/02/16, 18:43:28] Luc Hayward: It's fun
[2017/02/16, 18:44:35] Stuart Mesham: I am a pirate
[2017/02/16, 18:44:52] Stuart Mesham: The download has begun
[2017/02/16, 18:44:53] Luc Hayward: Yeah you are.
[2017/02/16, 18:45:49] Stuart Mesham: I'm probably gonna spend most of this evening trying random games from itch.io 🙈
[2017/02/16, 18:46:08] Luc Hayward: Most aren't great tbh. They have a desktop program
[2017/02/16, 18:46:43] Luc Hayward: Dbrand is 30%off
[2017/02/16, 18:46:53] Stuart Mesham: This is so cool
[2017/02/16, 18:48:06] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/02/16, 18:48:11] Luc Hayward: It's a whole new world
[2017/02/16, 18:50:03] Stuart Mesham: It is 😂
[2017/02/16, 18:50:18] Stuart Mesham: I think I might just stick to the website though since I'm a pirate
[2017/02/16, 18:50:32] Luc Hayward: The website isn't pirating you know
[2017/02/16, 18:51:10] Stuart Mesham: Lot's of them aren't free (on the website) though
[2017/02/16, 18:51:27] Luc Hayward: Yeah well people obviously want to make money
[2017/02/16, 18:53:11] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/02/16, 18:53:33] Stuart Mesham: Feels kinda bad pirating indie games but oh well
[2017/02/16, 18:53:52] Stuart Mesham: The alternative was just not playing them 😄 :(
[2017/02/16, 19:00:21] Luc Hayward: True true
[2017/02/16, 19:07:33] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/02/16, 19:49:55] Stuart Mesham: Naaah
[2017/02/16, 19:50:06] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/02/16, 19:50:21] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/02/16, 19:50:25] Stuart Mesham: You've shown me better ones 😄
[2017/02/16, 19:50:31] Luc Hayward: Worse*
[2017/02/16, 19:51:02] Stuart Mesham: Yeah not that one either
[2017/02/16, 19:52:02] Luc Hayward: Which did you like
[2017/02/16, 19:52:05] Luc Hayward: The wood?
[2017/02/16, 19:54:23] Stuart Mesham: The wood was pretty cool
[2017/02/16, 19:55:00] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/02/16, 20:10:07] Luc Hayward: These?
[2017/02/17, 08:49:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I think it was those
[2017/02/17, 14:45:45] Luc Hayward: wow
[2017/02/17, 14:45:49] Luc Hayward: this is really weird
[2017/02/17, 14:45:52] Luc Hayward: i dont like it
[2017/02/17, 14:46:30] Luc Hayward: python is like the middle child who tries to be cool but just fucks up and the old way was better at what it did anyway
[2017/02/17, 14:58:34] Stuart Mesham: It's because dynamic typing is awful right?
[2017/02/17, 14:59:13] Luc Hayward: It's just ew
[2017/02/17, 14:59:41] Luc Hayward: After more than like 500 lines you're going to start getting confused unless you comment the living hell out of every single variable
[2017/02/17, 14:59:59] Luc Hayward: And then you may as well have used static typing
[2017/02/17, 15:00:35] Stuart Mesham: It's not something I'd like to actually code with
[2017/02/17, 15:00:40] Luc Hayward: Hangouts?
[2017/02/17, 15:01:00] Stuart Mesham: Sure lemme just go upstairs quickly
[2017/02/17, 15:03:09] Luc Hayward: 👍
[2017/02/17, 15:06:30] Luc Hayward: actually I\m about to go out now
[2017/02/17, 15:06:34] Luc Hayward: will have to chat later
[2017/02/17, 15:06:39] Luc Hayward: but yeah it's weird
[2017/02/17, 15:07:52] Luc Hayward: chat later this evening about it
[2017/02/17, 15:10:31] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/02/17, 15:10:37] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it's so weird
[2017/02/17, 19:00:49] Luc Hayward: whaddup
[2017/02/17, 19:37:10] Luc Hayward: you around
[2017/02/17, 21:04:28] Stuart Mesham: Yep yep
[2017/02/17, 21:04:42] Stuart Mesham: I know that message may have expired
[2017/02/17, 22:54:28] Luc Hayward: Yeah...😂was watching suicide squad with my dad probably just missed you
[2017/02/18, 11:27:46] Luc Hayward: sup
[2017/02/18, 11:27:52] Stuart Mesham: Oh hi
[2017/02/18, 11:28:05] Stuart Mesham: That timing
[2017/02/18, 11:28:38] Luc Hayward: haha hey
[2017/02/18, 11:28:42] Luc Hayward: hangouts?
[2017/02/18, 11:29:53] Stuart Mesham: 5 minutes 👍🏻
[2017/02/18, 11:30:30] Luc Hayward: sounds good
[2017/02/18, 11:34:46] Stuart Mesham: Ok now
[2017/02/18, 11:35:22] Luc Hayward: 👌
[2017/02/20, 13:32:56] Luc Hayward: Do we know when we'll know or timetable?
[2017/02/20, 15:02:24] Stuart Mesham: Hey guess what
[2017/02/20, 15:02:31] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/02/20, 15:02:44] Stuart Mesham: Dan says we can look up our timetable already
[2017/02/20, 15:02:54] Luc Hayward: yeah I'm looking now
[2017/02/20, 15:03:09] Luc Hayward: problem is that it isnt tailored to us yet obviously so you have to sit through stuff like this
[2017/02/20, 15:03:25] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/02/20, 15:02:51] Stuart Mesham: I got my license! 🎉
[2017/02/20, 15:04:10] Luc Hayward: well done!!!!!
[2017/02/20, 15:04:19] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that's our only option at the moment I think
[2017/02/20, 15:04:21] Luc Hayward: so you're driving us in every day eh?
[2017/02/20, 15:04:31] Luc Hayward: we can check by course too
[2017/02/20, 15:04:53] Luc Hayward: also can't see where tests are yet
[2017/02/20, 15:05:17] Stuart Mesham: I'll be in res 😄
[2017/02/20, 15:05:22] Luc Hayward: also we have a long weekend after our first week of lectures (17th-21st) which uct seemingly doesnt let us have
[2017/02/20, 15:05:26] Luc Hayward: fuck
[2017/02/20, 15:05:49] Stuart Mesham: We still have lectures and stuff?
[2017/02/20, 15:06:11] Luc Hayward: yep
[2017/02/20, 15:06:14] Luc Hayward: faggs
[2017/02/20, 15:06:25] Luc Hayward: stellenbosch and every school in the country get monday off
[2017/02/20, 15:06:34] Luc Hayward: because tuesday is human rights day
[2017/02/20, 15:06:44] Luc Hayward: so schools have a school holiday on the mondy
[2017/02/20, 15:06:54] Luc Hayward: and stellenbosch has a class free day
[2017/02/20, 15:07:05] Luc Hayward: but uct are like lol fuck you tuesday is the holiday
[2017/02/20, 15:07:23] Luc Hayward: but if there isn't a test I'm taking the long weekend and going to knysna to see my dad
[2017/02/20, 15:38:12] Luc Hayward: we have clashes....
[2017/02/20, 15:46:42] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/02/20, 16:34:48] Luc Hayward: Nvm
[2017/02/20, 16:47:06] Stuart Mesham: Wut
[2017/02/20, 16:47:16] Stuart Mesham: Too much brain function for right now
[2017/02/20, 16:47:36] Stuart Mesham: I'll just ask Dan about my timetable when he gets home 👍🏻😄
[2017/02/20, 16:48:13] Luc Hayward: Eh emailed them. They said they don't try to make long weekends and it would all be explained
[2017/02/20, 16:48:22] Stuart Mesham: They sometimes do the same lecture multiple times a day
[2017/02/20, 16:48:29] Luc Hayward: Our* I'm probably taking genetics too already in first year
[2017/02/20, 16:48:38] Luc Hayward: They said that too yeah
[2017/02/20, 16:48:38] Stuart Mesham: (timetable question)
[2017/02/20, 16:48:56] Stuart Mesham: Eyy! 🙌🏻
[2017/02/20, 16:49:19] Luc Hayward: At least in first year **
[2017/02/20, 16:49:19] Stuart Mesham: See I'm not _that_ illogical
[2017/02/20, 16:49:39] Luc Hayward: Nope😂
[2017/02/20, 16:49:50] Stuart Mesham: Just to get a broad first year education
[2017/02/20, 16:49:56] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/02/20, 16:49:58] Luc Hayward: Like
[2017/02/20, 16:50:05] Luc Hayward: Im interested in game dev
[2017/02/20, 16:50:09] Luc Hayward: But also in genetics
[2017/02/20, 16:50:30] Luc Hayward: So either way I take basically the same number of courses (either genetics or electives)
[2017/02/20, 16:50:35] Luc Hayward: So I'm taking genetics
[2017/02/20, 16:51:04] Luc Hayward: And before second year starts, I can either swap to game dev and not have any prerequisites missing... Or I can stay with genetics
[2017/02/20, 16:51:42] Stuart Mesham: Ahem... because it's broader...
[2017/02/20, 17:06:50] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/02/20, 17:06:53] Luc Hayward: Lol yes
[2017/02/20, 17:06:55] Luc Hayward: You're right
[2017/02/20, 17:07:51] Luc Hayward: Yeah so it gives me a broad base to do either of them going forward
[2017/02/20, 17:08:00] Luc Hayward: So you can help me out 😂
[2017/02/20, 17:37:03] Stuart Mesham: Yeah sure 👌🏻😄
[2017/02/20, 17:37:12] Luc Hayward: :D
[2017/02/23, 09:13:19] Luc Hayward: ew
[2017/02/23, 09:13:20] Luc Hayward: ewew
[2017/02/23, 09:13:45] Luc Hayward: with classes in python you can just up and create class variables out of thin air
[2017/02/23, 09:14:40] Luc Hayward: ie class Shape(object):
        def __init__(self, num_sides):
[2017/02/23, 09:15:09] Luc Hayward: self.num_sides = num_sides
[2017/02/23, 09:15:18] Luc Hayward: so i can just make up the variable num_sides
[2017/02/23, 09:15:20] Luc Hayward: eww
[2017/02/23, 09:20:31] Stuart Mesham: Yyyyep 😄
[2017/02/23, 09:20:47] Luc Hayward: how is that at all a good idea
[2017/02/23, 09:20:43] Stuart Mesham: It does way more harm than good
[2017/02/23, 09:21:22] Luc Hayward: and their inheritance syntax is super confusing…
[2017/02/23, 09:24:32] Stuart Mesham: Haven't got to that yet
[2017/02/23, 09:25:16] Luc Hayward: ok well you know how basically eveything passes around this variable 'self' that refernce the current object
[2017/02/23, 09:25:20] Luc Hayward: ye it just is annoying
[2017/02/23, 09:25:49] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/02/23, 09:25:50] Stuart Mesham: Ew
[2017/02/23, 09:26:35] Luc Hayward: python is just generally seeming ugly in the log run. Also have you watched silicon valley
[2017/02/23, 09:26:43] Stuart Mesham: Then also I think when you want to access variables from outside the object you can't be sure that they exist 😷
[2017/02/23, 09:27:06] Stuart Mesham: Haven't I been telling you to watch silicon valley??? 😂
[2017/02/23, 09:27:21] Stuart Mesham: I LOVED silicon valley
[2017/02/23, 09:27:42] Luc Hayward: no I’ve been telling YOU to watch silicon valley and you were always like” meh doesn’t seem great”
[2017/02/23, 09:27:47] Stuart Mesham: In the week leading up to my AP maths exam I watched 2 seasons of it 😂
[2017/02/23, 09:27:58] Stuart Mesham: No that definitely wasn't me
[2017/02/23, 09:28:01] Luc Hayward: you know the next season starts airing in like april
[2017/02/23, 09:28:01] Stuart Mesham: That was Chris
[2017/02/23, 09:28:31] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I've got it in my calendar that's how sadly addicted I was 😂
[2017/02/23, 09:28:45] Luc Hayward: sooooo keen
[2017/02/23, 09:28:57] Stuart Mesham: I got so bleak when there were no more for me to binge
[2017/02/23, 09:29:08] Stuart Mesham: I was literally addicted
[2017/02/23, 09:29:11] Luc Hayward: right? have you watched the trailer?
[2017/02/23, 09:29:21] Stuart Mesham: I watched like 5 episodes a day 😄
[2017/02/23, 09:29:31] Stuart Mesham: The trailer's out???
[2017/02/23, 09:29:39] Stuart Mesham: Whaaat😱
[2017/02/23, 09:29:43] Stuart Mesham: Bye
[2017/02/23, 09:29:46] Stuart Mesham: YouTube time

[2017/02/23, 11:15:20] Stuart Mesham: I can't actually remember what happened at the end but I think I did
[2017/02/23, 11:16:03] Luc Hayward: Did you see yourself
[2017/02/23, 11:16:23] Stuart Mesham: I'm not sure
[2017/02/23, 11:16:34] Stuart Mesham: I remember the mind is software stuff

[2017/02/23, 11:20:22] Stuart Mesham: I got my driver's on Monday so now I'm not doing lessons anymore
[2017/02/23, 11:20:32] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/02/23, 11:20:39] Stuart Mesham: The lessons were the majority of my time before
[2017/02/23, 11:20:55] Luc Hayward: Well I finished teaching myself python as much as I feel I need to shop I'm bored af
[2017/02/23, 11:21:40] Stuart Mesham: Now I'm doing a combination of frivolous stuff and slowly going through some linear algebra stuff
[2017/02/23, 11:21:53] Stuart Mesham: Which is matrices and vectors
[2017/02/23, 11:21:55] Luc Hayward: Linear algebra?
[2017/02/23, 11:21:57] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/02/23, 11:22:02] Stuart Mesham: That sort of stuff
[2017/02/23, 11:22:22] Luc Hayward: Vector maths is simple though
[2017/02/23, 11:22:37] Stuart Mesham: I think it'll be useful to have a rough idea of what's cracking before the lectures 😄
[2017/02/23, 11:22:50] Stuart Mesham: Though I hear linear algebra isn't actually first year
[2017/02/23, 11:22:53] Luc Hayward: And matrices you aren't going to do for a while I'm sure
[2017/02/23, 11:23:42] Stuart Mesham: But yeah I just educate myself for a few hours a day
[2017/02/23, 11:23:59] Stuart Mesham: That's about all the productive stuff I'm doing at the moment
[2017/02/23, 11:24:12] Stuart Mesham: You still employed?
[2017/02/23, 11:24:29] Luc Hayward: Been I knysna for the past week
[2017/02/23, 11:24:36] Stuart Mesham: Right
[2017/02/23, 11:24:48] Stuart Mesham: Knysna's nice
[2017/02/23, 11:28:52] Luc Hayward: How are you reading yourself all this maths
[2017/02/23, 11:38:16] Stuart Mesham: Kahn Academy is the light and the way
[2017/02/23, 11:38:24] Stuart Mesham: It is the fountain of knowledge
[2017/02/23, 11:38:37] Luc Hayward: Of course
[2017/02/23, 11:39:29] Stuart Mesham: It was a large part of my AP maths studying too
[2017/02/23, 11:39:41] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/02/23, 14:04:32] Luc Hayward: You know what makes me cry
[2017/02/23, 14:04:55] Luc Hayward: In the first 6 days Crissy road pulled over 60000 dollars US
[2017/02/23, 14:05:55] Luc Hayward: In a little over a month they make 2.2 mil
[2017/02/23, 14:07:40] Luc Hayward: 125k on Christmas day alone😭
[2017/02/23, 15:13:15] Stuart Mesham: Oh my god I hate them 😂
[2017/02/23, 15:22:33] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/02/23, 15:22:43] Luc Hayward: 10 mil in revenue
[2017/02/23, 15:22:56] Luc Hayward: I'd take 10% of that
[2017/02/23, 16:21:22] Stuart Mesham: I'd pretty happy even with 1%
[2017/02/23, 16:21:35] Luc Hayward: fuck that too
[2017/02/24, 10:17:56] Stuart Mesham: WhatsApp made a Snapchat stories function 😕
[2017/02/24, 10:18:07] Luc Hayward: I know
[2017/02/24, 10:18:16] Stuart Mesham: Why
[2017/02/24, 10:18:21] Luc Hayward: So Stu are you coming camping?
[2017/02/24, 10:18:20] Stuart Mesham: Just
[2017/02/24, 10:18:26] Stuart Mesham: Came out of nowhere
[2017/02/24, 10:18:32] Luc Hayward: Aren't they owned by Fb? Fb has stories everywhere now
[2017/02/24, 10:18:41] Stuart Mesham: Let me read the messages
[2017/02/24, 10:18:51] Luc Hayward: That might take a while
[2017/02/24, 10:19:00] Stuart Mesham: Still it seems quite out of place on WhatsApp
[2017/02/24, 10:19:54] Luc Hayward: The gist if it is camping for 2 nights at beaverlac. The plan is 31st of march and 1st of April (unless Olivia convinces everyone to go the weekend before which is not great for me)
[2017/02/24, 10:22:21] Stuart Mesham: According to my calendar I'm free both of those weekends
[2017/02/24, 10:22:34] Luc Hayward: 👌🏻
[2017/02/24, 10:22:53] Stuart Mesham: Also quite keen for camping
[2017/02/24, 10:23:33] Luc Hayward: Cool beans
[2017/02/24, 10:23:48] Stuart Mesham: Oh I see the WhatsApp thing is just like recent updates on bbm
[2017/02/24, 10:24:04] Stuart Mesham: It shows the last people to change their status I think
[2017/02/24, 10:24:07] Luc Hayward: I'm angling to drive you holly and Boyd so I don't get stuck dealing with indecisive people
[2017/02/24, 10:24:33] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm cool with that 👍🏻😄
[2017/02/24, 10:24:59] Luc Hayward: Soon you need to go register on their website for me because your 18

[2017/02/24, 10:25:57] Luc Hayward: Yeah everyone who's 18 must be registered
[2017/02/24, 10:26:08] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/02/24, 10:27:02] Luc Hayward: And then you'll have to send me you ID number too because the driver of the vehicle has to do the booking, so if we take 3 cars each car is it's separate booking
[2017/02/24, 10:32:25] Stuart Mesham: I feel like I'm getting phished 😂

[2017/02/24, 10:58:31] Stuart Mesham: Wait does this friends thing have nothing to do with our camping booking?
[2017/02/24, 10:58:40] Luc Hayward: Absolutely nothing
[2017/02/24, 10:59:09] Luc Hayward: They just require over 18 to be registered else they won't confirm your booking request
[2017/02/24, 10:59:27] Stuart Mesham: Oh this is so weird
[2017/02/24, 11:01:31] Stuart Mesham: 9804045258080

[2017/02/28, 18:51:32] Luc Hayward: You can drive
[2017/02/28, 18:51:44] Luc Hayward: How is driving to me any more effort than me going to you
[2017/02/28, 19:30:23] Stuart Mesham: I don't have a car

[2017/03/01, 11:05:31] Luc Hayward: Doubt it. 😂 Apple make so much money off chargers
[2017/03/01, 11:05:48] Luc Hayward: Although it would make sense to unite their cable systen
[2017/03/01, 13:20:38] Stuart Mesham: That's very true 😂
[2017/03/01, 13:21:26] Stuart Mesham: But life would be a dream if one cable could charge iPhones, Android phones and laptops
[2017/03/01, 13:21:36] Stuart Mesham: And connect monitors!
[2017/03/01, 13:21:59] Luc Hayward: It would be great
[2017/03/01, 13:22:02] Stuart Mesham: Which USB-C can do
[2017/03/01, 13:22:50] Luc Hayward: No thunderbolt 3 can do that
[2017/03/01, 13:22:59] Luc Hayward: USB C is just the connector
[2017/03/01, 13:23:15] Luc Hayward: You can get USB 2.0 type C
[2017/03/01, 15:06:33] Stuart Mesham: Wut

[2017/03/01, 15:08:05] Luc Hayward: usb types (the actual connector)
[2017/03/01, 15:08:17] Luc Hayward: usb speeds (ie usb 3.0)

[2017/03/06, 08:54:51] Luc Hayward: Right?
[2017/03/06, 08:54:58] Luc Hayward: But when it's their orientation then
[2017/03/06, 08:55:05] Stuart Mesham: This is way too small 😂
[2017/03/06, 08:55:14] Luc Hayward: But then where are they....
[2017/03/06, 08:55:34] Stuart Mesham: Good question 🙈😄
[2017/03/06, 08:55:46] Luc Hayward: Logically this is everyone
[2017/03/06, 08:55:46] Stuart Mesham: Maybe they banked on lots not showing up
[2017/03/06, 08:55:51] Luc Hayward: Maybe
[2017/03/06, 08:55:57] Luc Hayward: But everyone has to register
[2017/03/06, 08:56:12] Stuart Mesham: And then told people who didn't fit to go somewhere else 😄
[2017/03/06, 08:56:18] Stuart Mesham: True true

[2017/03/06, 09:44:48] Luc Hayward: Then again there are so many WiFi APs in this place it's not wonder they have network congestion
[2017/03/06, 09:45:04] Stuart Mesham: Yeah

[2017/03/06, 10:23:25] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/03/06, 10:26:26] Luc Hayward: Full that registration crap out with me so we end up in the same stuff

[2017/03/06, 18:15:36] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/06, 18:15:42] Stuart Mesham: I see
[2017/03/06, 18:16:12] Stuart Mesham: I thought this was in the handbook 🙈
[2017/03/06, 18:17:11] Stuart Mesham: I'm guessing we just write SB001 again on the next line for genetics?
[2017/03/06, 18:17:29] Luc Hayward: i dont think we write it twice
[2017/03/06, 18:17:57] Stuart Mesham: What else do we put there??
[2017/03/06, 18:18:11] Stuart Mesham: Write it twice!
[2017/03/06, 18:18:28] Luc Hayward: i think we just put it in once
[2017/03/06, 18:18:38] Luc Hayward: because its only one degree
[2017/03/06, 18:18:42] Luc Hayward: we dont take the degree twice
[2017/03/06, 18:18:54] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/03/06, 18:19:05] Luc Hayward: besides it doesnt ultimately matter because we sit witha student advisor to check it all
[2017/03/06, 18:19:17] Stuart Mesham: Oh true
[2017/03/06, 18:19:28] Stuart Mesham: They'll tell us if we've messed it up
[2017/03/06, 18:19:40] Luc Hayward: and they probably have like a hundred spare sheets for people like us who fuck it up
[2017/03/06, 18:19:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😄
[2017/03/06, 18:22:47] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/06, 18:23:44] Stuart Mesham: Checking...
[2017/03/06, 18:25:05] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/06, 18:25:38] Stuart Mesham: It's the non-bio stats that we can do
[2017/03/06, 18:25:48] Luc Hayward: yeah the one my finger is on
[2017/03/06, 18:25:53] Luc Hayward: STA1000S?
[2017/03/06, 18:26:00] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/06, 18:26:18] Stuart Mesham: It says F/S
[2017/03/06, 18:26:33] Stuart Mesham: So you can presumably do it first or second semester
[2017/03/06, 18:27:00] Luc Hayward: Yeah but if you check the entry in the handbook it says we can only do it in second
[2017/03/06, 18:27:06] Luc Hayward: And that works better with out timetable
[2017/03/06, 18:27:18] Luc Hayward: Cus we have to ha e done a half year of maths first I believe
[2017/03/06, 18:27:35] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/03/06, 18:30:08] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/06, 18:30:31] Luc Hayward: you're also just filling this in and hoping it's right?
[2017/03/06, 18:30:39] Luc Hayward: and just fixing it on the day if we need to?
[2017/03/06, 18:31:30] Stuart Mesham: You mean the timetable?
[2017/03/06, 18:31:47] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/03/06, 18:32:13] Stuart Mesham: I'm first gonna write the times on my note on my laptop
[2017/03/06, 18:32:22] Stuart Mesham: Then I'll fill and hope

[2017/03/06, 18:32:49] Luc Hayward: Same
[2017/03/06, 18:32:54] Stuart Mesham: There it is if you want it
[2017/03/06, 18:32:57] Luc Hayward: I'll get back to you godmother is arriving
[2017/03/06, 18:33:06] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/03/06, 18:37:21] Luc Hayward: Now what do we do here
[2017/03/06, 18:37:39] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/06, 18:38:14] Stuart Mesham: On page 185 in the handbook, what does the middle column mean? (e.g. "2 or 4 M to W, F")
[2017/03/06, 18:38:39] Luc Hayward: it means 2(period) M(monday)
[2017/03/06, 18:38:41] Stuart Mesham: I'll get to the 2018 and 2019 stuff later
[2017/03/06, 18:38:55] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/03/06, 18:40:01] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/03/06, 18:40:02] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/03/06, 18:40:09] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/03/06, 18:40:15] Luc Hayward: Those are lecture times
[2017/03/06, 18:40:25] Luc Hayward: Then the column to the right of it are practical times
[2017/03/06, 18:41:57] Stuart Mesham: Do practicals go throughout the year?
[2017/03/06, 18:42:02] Luc Hayward: So stats is decided by department
[2017/03/06, 18:42:18] Stuart Mesham: Hm?
[2017/03/06, 18:42:35] Luc Hayward: stats times just say decided by department
[2017/03/06, 18:42:45] Luc Hayward: and yes pracs are throughout the year each week i believe
[2017/03/06, 18:42:54] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/03/06, 18:43:29] Stuart Mesham: I think I might actually just put one week of lectures into my phone and see if it works
[2017/03/06, 18:43:41] Luc Hayward: im doing it now for us if you like
[2017/03/06, 18:43:54] Stuart Mesham: Pracs as well
[2017/03/06, 18:44:54] Stuart Mesham: The comp sci department should definitely have made a program that works out your timetable for you 😄
[2017/03/06, 18:45:07] Luc Hayward: adding those now
[2017/03/06, 18:45:11] Luc Hayward: they basically do
[2017/03/06, 18:45:29] Luc Hayward: once you register within 48 hours your personal time table should be on the app/vula
[2017/03/06, 18:45:51] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/03/06, 18:46:11] Stuart Mesham: So why do we have to work this out? 😂
[2017/03/06, 18:46:26] Luc Hayward: not a fucking clue maybe science faculty are hated
[2017/03/06, 18:46:49] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😄
[2017/03/06, 18:46:57] Luc Hayward: also pracs can be any day of the week it isnt fixed
[2017/03/06, 18:47:28] Stuart Mesham: So we don't have to worry about it or do we?
[2017/03/06, 18:47:48] Luc Hayward: and multiple hours
[2017/03/06, 18:48:47] Stuart Mesham: Then maybe we don't have to plan for them
[2017/03/06, 18:53:23] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/06, 18:53:58] Luc Hayward: so that top section is for lectures, first semester then second semester and the days we have lectures on
[2017/03/06, 18:54:07] Luc Hayward: next section is first semster practical times
[2017/03/06, 18:54:57] Luc Hayward: alkl seem to only be one prac per week
[2017/03/06, 18:55:15] Stuart Mesham: Cool thanks
[2017/03/06, 18:55:36] Luc Hayward: all the courses have one tut per week i think and its in a lecture time
[2017/03/06, 18:55:50] Luc Hayward: hoping i got all of that right
[2017/03/06, 18:57:20] Stuart Mesham: Last lecture starts at 12 and all the pracs seem to start at 2 or later so there shouldn't be clashes between pracs and lectures
[2017/03/06, 18:59:48] Luc Hayward: yeah thats true
[2017/03/06, 19:07:39] Luc Hayward: now what do we do for the other two years?
[2017/03/06, 19:07:50] Luc Hayward: I'm just going to leave those blank i think till wednesday
[2017/03/06, 19:08:09] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/06, 19:16:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah mine's also looking like that
[2017/03/06, 19:19:31] Luc Hayward: Cool beans all sorted
[2017/03/06, 19:29:56] Stuart Mesham: Awe
[2017/03/06, 19:30:39] Luc Hayward: also our society/sports sign ups are only starting tomrorrow
[2017/03/06, 19:31:40] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/06, 19:31:56] Luc Hayward: You gonna even bother to read this stuff?
[2017/03/06, 19:33:37] Luc Hayward: Meh
[2017/03/06, 19:33:42] Luc Hayward: Also where is your res
[2017/03/06, 19:33:57] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/06, 19:34:12] Stuart Mesham: Nah, don't think we need this
[2017/03/06, 19:34:31] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/06, 19:34:41] Luc Hayward: where is it
[2017/03/06, 19:34:59] Stuart Mesham: Above and to the left of the soccer field
[2017/03/06, 19:36:00] Stuart Mesham: I can't get my outlook to work 😩
[2017/03/06, 19:36:47] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/06, 19:37:21] Luc Hayward: can help you tomorrow whats causing issues\
[2017/03/06, 19:37:23] Stuart Mesham: Move your finger to the left
[2017/03/06, 19:38:04] Stuart Mesham: The entrance is near that big 90° in the blue line
[2017/03/06, 19:38:12] Luc Hayward: oh sweet
[2017/03/06, 19:38:42] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it's nice and close
[2017/03/06, 19:38:46] Stuart Mesham: Walking distance
[2017/03/06, 19:40:13] Luc Hayward: sorta
[2017/03/06, 19:40:49] Stuart Mesham: Yeah close is a relative term
[2017/03/06, 19:41:49] Luc Hayward: i gues its like 1km
[2017/03/06, 19:41:54] Luc Hayward: so 15 min walk
[2017/03/06, 19:42:54] Luc Hayward: need to work out these jammie chuttle routes and where to park though ...
[2017/03/06, 20:19:49] Stuart Mesham: Ffffffffffffffuck I just kicked a rock too hard 😑
[2017/03/06, 20:19:50] Stuart Mesham: Now my toe is bleeding
[2017/03/06, 20:19:50] Stuart Mesham: Sorry to burden you with that info
[2017/03/06, 20:28:03] Luc Hayward: G fucking g 😂😂😂😂
[2017/03/06, 20:32:12] Stuart Mesham: I need to choose my battles better
[2017/03/06, 20:45:56] Luc Hayward: You do....
[2017/03/06, 20:46:11] Luc Hayward: Go to the app and book for your student card
[2017/03/06, 20:46:34] Stuart Mesham: The app?
[2017/03/06, 20:51:49] Luc Hayward: Search uct on app store
[2017/03/06, 20:52:03] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/06, 20:52:13] Luc Hayward: We register according to major
[2017/03/06, 20:52:42] Luc Hayward: So do we register with the comp sci session? Or genetics
[2017/03/06, 20:53:16] Stuart Mesham: I think I'm gonna do the registration tomorrow or later
[2017/03/06, 20:53:29] Luc Hayward: It's on Wednesday only
[2017/03/06, 20:53:37] Stuart Mesham: I'm trying to deal with this toe rn
[2017/03/06, 20:53:52] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/03/06, 20:54:04] Stuart Mesham: I meant the app registration
[2017/03/06, 20:54:10] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😬
[2017/03/06, 20:54:32] Luc Hayward: Oh right
[2017/03/07, 08:45:32] Luc Hayward: Get up come right
[2017/03/07, 09:23:02] Luc Hayward: Next year were going to end up with 4 first semester courses and 2 second....Three second if we put stats there ...
[2017/03/07, 10:37:44] Luc Hayward: Where you?
[2017/03/07, 10:38:11] Stuart Mesham: Inside by the food place
[2017/03/07, 10:38:28] Stuart Mesham: Where we stopped earlier
[2017/03/07, 10:38:31] Luc Hayward: Oh lol was just there
[2017/03/07, 10:38:47] Stuart Mesham: Oh lol
[2017/03/07, 15:18:06] Luc Hayward: Wednesday, March 8, 2017, 12:00pm
[2017/03/07, 16:44:03] Luc Hayward: When and how do we find out about/get our textbooks?
[2017/03/07, 17:31:01] Stuart Mesham: Not sure
[2017/03/07, 17:31:22] Stuart Mesham: I'll look it up later
[2017/03/07, 17:31:29] Stuart Mesham: Got a braai now 😄
[2017/03/07, 17:34:57] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/03/07, 17:35:09] Luc Hayward: We must find out where we get second hand books
[2017/03/07, 23:10:03] Stuart Mesham: Damn an advertising guy gave me a flyer for a "buy and sell textbooks _fast_" website but I threw it away
[2017/03/07, 23:28:21] Stuart Mesham: Registered for 10-11 tomorrow so I'll probably come a bit later
[2017/03/08, 06:32:24] Luc Hayward: Well done
[2017/03/08, 06:32:30] Luc Hayward: What do you mean ?
[2017/03/08, 06:32:54] Luc Hayward: The chick said 9
[2017/03/08, 08:44:31] Stuart Mesham: But we only have to go at the time we're registered?
[2017/03/08, 08:44:54] Stuart Mesham: I booked on the app for 10-11
[2017/03/08, 08:47:44] Luc Hayward: Ok the app!
[2017/03/08, 08:47:47] Luc Hayward: ?*
[2017/03/08, 08:47:52] Luc Hayward: That's for student cards
[2017/03/08, 08:48:05] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/08, 08:48:04] Stuart Mesham: Fine
[2017/03/08, 08:48:19] Stuart Mesham: I'll come now then 😂
[2017/03/08, 08:48:27] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/08, 08:49:14] Stuart Mesham: Ouch shame
[2017/03/08, 08:49:21] Stuart Mesham: I'll be up now
[2017/03/08, 08:49:31] Luc Hayward: 👌🏻
[2017/03/08, 08:49:36] Stuart Mesham: I'll bring my ID
[2017/03/08, 08:50:02] Luc Hayward: Yeah do that
[2017/03/08, 08:51:57] Stuart Mesham: Just gotta brush my teeth and stuff
[2017/03/08, 09:02:42] Stuart Mesham: Which building are you?
[2017/03/08, 09:15:45] Luc Hayward: The one we had the comp sci talk in
[2017/03/08, 09:48:43] Luc Hayward: Hows yours going
[2017/03/08, 09:48:51] Luc Hayward: Go to the guy on the right
[2017/03/08, 09:49:01] Luc Hayward: The guy who gave the talk on computer science
[2017/03/08, 09:49:20] Luc Hayward: Cus he already now knows about my closest selection which is the same as yours
[2017/03/08, 09:49:25] Stuart Mesham: Too late
[2017/03/08, 09:49:30] Luc Hayward: Oh rip
[2017/03/08, 09:49:38] Luc Hayward: Where you now
[2017/03/08, 09:49:41] Stuart Mesham: I'm already in the other line
[2017/03/08, 09:49:45] Luc Hayward: Ah
[2017/03/08, 09:49:50] Stuart Mesham: Half way
[2017/03/08, 09:49:57] Luc Hayward: Ok so what you want to point out is the stats course
[2017/03/08, 09:50:10] Luc Hayward: We can't take stats this year because there are too many subjects already
[2017/03/08, 09:50:10] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/08, 09:50:29] Luc Hayward: But we can't take stats next year either because there are too many courses
[2017/03/08, 09:50:42] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/03/08, 09:50:52] Luc Hayward: And next year we have 4 first semester and 2 second semester courses which he also complained about
[2017/03/08, 09:51:01] Luc Hayward: So just being that up with them so they know
[2017/03/08, 09:51:14] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/03/08, 09:51:29] Luc Hayward: He said to me it had never been a problem with genetics and comp sci before though
[2017/03/08, 09:52:06] Luc Hayward: And that he thinks something changed since last year but that he's sure it won't be a big issue and that we can get special permission
[2017/03/08, 09:52:27] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks
[2017/03/08, 09:52:35] Stuart Mesham: I'll bring this up
[2017/03/08, 09:52:59] Luc Hayward: 👍🏼
[2017/03/08, 10:01:19] Luc Hayward: I'm gonna spend my time after this learning where to park and shuttles and stuff
[2017/03/08, 10:01:53] Stuart Mesham: K
[2017/03/08, 10:02:20] Luc Hayward: Get hold of me after you do data capture
[2017/03/08, 10:02:25] Stuart Mesham: Don't think that applies to me 😄
[2017/03/08, 10:02:34] Stuart Mesham: See you then
[2017/03/08, 10:02:57] Luc Hayward: Nope 😂
[2017/03/08, 11:07:06] Luc Hayward: Hows it going g
[2017/03/08, 11:15:49] Stuart Mesham: Sitting in a long line
[2017/03/08, 11:16:22] Stuart Mesham: When you get there, tell me which queue ended up being faster 😄
[2017/03/08, 11:16:43] Luc Hayward: For data capture?
[2017/03/08, 11:16:58] Luc Hayward: Yeah sure
[2017/03/08, 11:17:10] Stuart Mesham: No for student card
[2017/03/08, 11:17:19] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/03/08, 11:54:34] Stuart Mesham: So which one?
[2017/03/08, 11:54:43] Luc Hayward: Left
[2017/03/08, 11:59:14] Stuart Mesham: Thanks 👌🏻

[2017/03/08, 14:05:22] Luc Hayward: For
[2017/03/08, 14:06:17] Stuart Mesham: You'll have to look somewhere else if you want to be beeded
[2017/03/08, 14:20:11] Luc Hayward: This is a load of shit
[2017/03/08, 14:20:20] Luc Hayward: And I'm too far from a door to run away

[2017/03/11, 20:17:27] Luc Hayward: And if you changed with me, our tut is only Wednesday 2-4?
[2017/03/11, 20:18:03] Luc Hayward: So for Monday it's just making sure we know our schedule, venues and read the announcements and the intro stuff
[2017/03/11, 22:44:50] Stuart Mesham: I was doing it this afternoon, they're quite long
[2017/03/12, 10:54:20] Stuart Mesham: Our tutorial is also tomorrow 🙈
[2017/03/12, 11:33:36] Luc Hayward: No it isnt
[2017/03/12, 11:33:41] Luc Hayward: I moved it to Wednesday
[2017/03/12, 11:34:04] Luc Hayward: Move yours too you chop
[2017/03/12, 11:34:19] Luc Hayward: Oh fuck
[2017/03/12, 11:36:19] Luc Hayward: No man
[2017/03/12, 11:36:32] Luc Hayward: I changed it back
[2017/03/12, 11:36:37] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/12, 11:36:44] Luc Hayward: Made it Wednesday 2-4
[2017/03/12, 11:36:47] Luc Hayward: In m202
[2017/03/12, 11:39:23] Luc Hayward: I didn't want to do Monday
[2017/03/12, 11:39:43] Stuart Mesham: Oh I didn't see there was another m202
[2017/03/12, 11:39:49] Luc Hayward: Yrah
[2017/03/12, 11:40:18] Luc Hayward: Come join me there if you like :)
[2017/03/12, 11:44:26] Stuart Mesham: Ooh what's the catch here
[2017/03/12, 11:44:40] Stuart Mesham: There are 0 places available in the Monday one
[2017/03/12, 11:45:12] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/03/12, 11:45:14] Luc Hayward: I know
[2017/03/12, 11:45:22] Stuart Mesham: Gonna check for timetable clashes before I switch 😂
[2017/03/12, 11:45:44] Luc Hayward: There aren't?
[2017/03/12, 11:45:56] Luc Hayward: Unless you've been assigned a different bio practice than me
[2017/03/12, 11:45:55] Stuart Mesham: Just gotta make sure there isn't a reason why everyone else is on Monday that also applies to me
[2017/03/12, 11:46:06] Luc Hayward: We have a bio practice somewhere from 2-5
[2017/03/12, 11:46:10] Luc Hayward: Mine is on a Tuesday
[2017/03/12, 11:46:21] Luc Hayward: It will show up in your timetable on the uct app
[2017/03/12, 11:46:26] Stuart Mesham: Mine also says Tuesday
[2017/03/12, 11:47:17] Stuart Mesham: I'll wait until they tell us when our bio prac is
[2017/03/12, 11:48:11] Luc Hayward: Yeah so it's on Tuesday
[2017/03/12, 11:48:16] Stuart Mesham: They said they're dividing us into groups and I have a feeling that Tuesday thing on PeopleSoft is just a default time that everyone is seeing at the moment
[2017/03/12, 11:48:25] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/03/12, 11:50:05] Luc Hayward: So why do you want to stay in Monday ? Ok well either way doesn't matter. I changed to Wednesday. If it becomes a clash I change again no biggie
[2017/03/12, 11:50:20] Luc Hayward: Leaving my tut on Wednesday for now
[2017/03/12, 11:50:29] Stuart Mesham: That's the thing, you can't 🙈
[2017/03/12, 11:50:42] Stuart Mesham: You can't rejoin Monday because it's full
[2017/03/12, 11:51:54] Stuart Mesham: I'm thinking if there's a clash with Monday I can change Monday to Wednesday and still get m202.
But if there's a clash with Wednesday you can't change Wednesday to Monday and might not get m202
[2017/03/12, 11:51:56] Luc Hayward: Rip
[2017/03/12, 11:52:05] Luc Hayward: Sounds smart
[2017/03/12, 11:52:07] Luc Hayward: Ok cool
[2017/03/12, 11:52:10] Stuart Mesham: That's why I'm gonna just wait in Monday for a while 😄
[2017/03/12, 11:52:17] Luc Hayward: Let's find each other tomorrow before maths ?
[2017/03/12, 11:52:24] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/12, 11:52:26] Luc Hayward: Keegan and I are hoping to arrive by 7:30
[2017/03/12, 11:52:44] Stuart Mesham: Is Keegan doing Maths?
[2017/03/12, 11:53:03] Luc Hayward: Keegan is taking comp sci so yeah
[2017/03/12, 11:53:12] Luc Hayward: Second major is game dev
[2017/03/12, 11:55:54] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/03/12, 11:56:16] Luc Hayward: Ye
[2017/03/12, 12:16:21] Luc Hayward: you planning to use pycharm this year still>
[2017/03/12, 12:16:24] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/03/12, 12:16:28] Luc Hayward: or netbeans
[2017/03/12, 12:16:31] Luc Hayward: for python
[2017/03/12, 12:17:01] Stuart Mesham: Pycharm for Python
[2017/03/12, 12:17:10] Stuart Mesham: It's just better.
[2017/03/12, 12:17:17] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/03/12, 12:17:21] Luc Hayward: and netbeans for java
[2017/03/12, 12:17:42] Stuart Mesham: It has autocomplete which NetBeans does not 😄
[2017/03/12, 12:17:58] Luc Hayward: oh wow
[2017/03/12, 12:18:00] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/03/12, 12:18:01] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/03/12, 12:18:06] Stuart Mesham: Good autocomplete
[2017/03/12, 12:18:10] Luc Hayward: pycharm (jus tthe free community version?)
[2017/03/12, 12:18:16] Luc Hayward: and then netbeans for java
[2017/03/12, 12:18:16] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/12, 12:18:30] Stuart Mesham: Wait does UCT give us a paid pycharm license?
[2017/03/12, 12:18:39] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/03/12, 12:18:51] Luc Hayward: they use some other bullshit ide from like 10 years ago
[2017/03/12, 12:20:23] Stuart Mesham: Apparently it's better not to use NetBeans for our Java course because we need to learn the syntax (we write some Java tests on paper) so it's better to use this other IDE which is basically windows notepad with a compile and run button so that we learn the syntax off by heart
[2017/03/12, 12:20:57] Luc Hayward: what! thats fucking awful.
[2017/03/12, 12:21:00] Luc Hayward: it goes so slowly
[2017/03/12, 12:21:06] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/03/12, 12:21:05] Stuart Mesham: There was a pycharm installed on the lab computers though
[2017/03/12, 12:21:12] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😄
[2017/03/12, 12:21:24] Luc Hayward: well we can do what we did in IT at reddam sometimes
[2017/03/12, 12:21:33] Luc Hayward: I'll show you on tuesday or during break or something
[2017/03/12, 12:21:41] Stuart Mesham: What's that?
[2017/03/12, 12:22:25] Luc Hayward: we would write in sublime text (text editor but has lots of plugins if you want hem) because it has really nice dark themes by default and has syntax highlighting for basically every single language including sql
[2017/03/12, 12:22:58] Luc Hayward: and then we would just copy the whole program back into JGrasp
[2017/03/12, 12:23:04] Luc Hayward: which is like what you were saying
[2017/03/12, 12:23:12] Luc Hayward: has no autocomplete or intellisense or anything
[2017/03/12, 12:23:21] Luc Hayward: just an auto format for indenting, compile and run
[2017/03/12, 12:23:47] Stuart Mesham: No the point is to write a lot in JGrasp so you get used to writing without even code highlighting 😂
[2017/03/12, 12:23:51] Luc Hayward: also has some debugging stuff but point is that it has no intellisense and it wont show errors until you tell it to compile manually
[2017/03/12, 12:24:03] Luc Hayward: but code highlighting is bae
[2017/03/12, 12:24:13] Luc Hayward: it just makes code so much easier to read
[2017/03/12, 12:24:23] Luc Hayward: it's like punctuation for code
[2017/03/12, 12:24:27] Stuart Mesham: So you get used to what mistakes you usually forget and then don't make those mistakes in the tests 🙈😂
[2017/03/12, 12:24:36] Luc Hayward: ah fair enough
[2017/03/12, 12:24:57] Luc Hayward: i think Jgrasp has some very rudimentary sytax highlighting for like class names
[2017/03/12, 12:25:08] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I think JGrasp was the one he was using (the 2nd year I talked to)
[2017/03/12, 12:25:12] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/03/12, 12:25:15] Luc Hayward: jgrasp is good
[2017/03/12, 12:25:20] Luc Hayward: i used it quite a bit
[2017/03/12, 12:25:31] Stuart Mesham: Rough but good for this purpose 😄
[2017/03/12, 12:25:54] Stuart Mesham: I would never use it for one of my actual projects 😂
[2017/03/12, 12:26:02] Luc Hayward: ah ok
[2017/03/12, 12:26:06] Luc Hayward: good
[2017/03/12, 12:26:09] Luc Hayward: glad we agreed on that
[2017/03/12, 12:26:20] Luc Hayward: in which case is there even a point in me installing pycharm
[2017/03/12, 12:26:37] Luc Hayward: like are we planning to do any projects(you and I) in python anyime soon?
[2017/03/12, 12:26:44] Stuart Mesham: Wait JGrasp for python???
[2017/03/12, 12:27:01] Stuart Mesham: I thought we were just talking about Java
[2017/03/12, 12:27:25] Stuart Mesham: I'll ask Dan what he recommends
[2017/03/12, 12:30:35] Luc Hayward: oh uhm you're right i dont think jgrasp handles anyhting but java
[2017/03/12, 12:30:39] Luc Hayward: sorry no
[2017/03/12, 12:30:47] Luc Hayward: yeah jgrasp for java but what about python
[2017/03/12, 12:31:08] Luc Hayward: i mean do we use pycharm ? or do we do everything in a text editor to get used to it?
[2017/03/12, 12:32:45] Luc Hayward: did dan take comp sci courses?
[2017/03/12, 12:34:04] Stuart Mesham: The J in JGrasp makes me think not 😂
[2017/03/12, 12:34:16] Luc Hayward: Hmmm just maybe hey?
[2017/03/12, 12:35:26] Stuart Mesham: We at least need an IDE that has a save and run button. We can't save and run from the terminal every time. That's way too rough. 😂
[2017/03/12, 12:35:46] Stuart Mesham: Yeah Dan did comp sci courses as electives
[2017/03/12, 12:35:51] Luc Hayward: Sooooo pycharm
[2017/03/12, 12:36:05] Luc Hayward: and we can just turn off intellisense and syntax highlighting?
[2017/03/12, 12:36:15] Stuart Mesham: Maybe that's the answer
[2017/03/12, 12:36:30] Stuart Mesham: Dan's not here at the moment, I'll ask when he gets back
[2017/03/12, 12:37:51] Luc Hayward: ok cool
[2017/03/12, 12:38:12] Luc Hayward: I'll grab it anyway
[2017/03/12, 12:38:19] Luc Hayward: not like im short on space really
[2017/03/12, 12:38:32] Luc Hayward: have my pc and my external  to supplement the laptops 256
[2017/03/12, 12:39:06] Stuart Mesham: Are you using the air?
[2017/03/12, 12:41:13] Luc Hayward: nah
[2017/03/12, 12:41:16] Luc Hayward: got my laptop yesterday
[2017/03/12, 12:41:21] Luc Hayward: last years 15 inch
[2017/03/12, 13:05:41] Luc Hayward: hey man I have to write up a time table with venue on it anyway for myself so shall i send to you too?
[2017/03/12, 14:06:47] Stuart Mesham: Nah I got that down
[2017/03/12, 14:07:34] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/12, 16:36:00] Luc Hayward: Is that Google calendar?
[2017/03/12, 16:36:06] Luc Hayward: I haven't been using it is it worth?
[2017/03/12, 16:36:24] Stuart Mesham: No it's a timetable app that I have
[2017/03/12, 16:36:33] Stuart Mesham: But YES Google calendar is worth it
[2017/03/12, 16:36:35] Luc Hayward: Oh tell me it ?
[2017/03/12, 16:36:56] Stuart Mesham: Especially since you have a Mac
[2017/03/12, 16:37:26] Stuart Mesham: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabrielittner.timetable
[2017/03/12, 16:47:02] Luc Hayward: Well I mean my calendar is liked to my google account so it is synced across my devices
[2017/03/12, 17:03:16] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it's really worth it, the notifications especially since they come up on your phone and your laptop 👌🏻
[2017/03/12, 17:16:22] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/12, 17:20:21] Stuart Mesham: Yes! That's the way to do it! Use Google calendar with whatever calendar client is built into the device you're on! And the timetable app is pretty good too. I used it for school and it worked brilliantly there. 👌🏻
[2017/03/12, 17:21:44] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/12, 17:21:53] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/12, 17:22:46] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/12, 17:31:39] Stuart Mesham: Yeah you can share events with others
[2017/03/12, 17:31:58] Stuart Mesham: Is your account luchay10?
[2017/03/12, 17:32:06] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/03/12, 17:32:29] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/12, 17:32:59] Stuart Mesham: I just did a search, I don't think there's an iOS version
[2017/03/12, 17:34:43] Stuart Mesham: I invited you to the Silicon Valley season 4 release 😄
[2017/03/12, 17:38:41] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/12, 18:02:17] Luc Hayward: Or timetable is always the same everyday
[2017/03/12, 18:02:25] Luc Hayward: I think we will learn it really fast
[2017/03/12, 18:31:58] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/12, 18:35:03] Luc Hayward: i found a timetable app but its not as nice as yours
[2017/03/12, 18:35:11] Luc Hayward: doesnt let me put in due dates for things
[2017/03/12, 18:35:21] Luc Hayward: gonna have to keep using calendar/reminders for that
[2017/03/12, 19:15:30] Luc Hayward: https://vula.uct.ac.za/portal/site/0424ce89-87b4-4050-a908-ace2654a4d69/tool/c43a2e05-f9d4-4972-b99f-1beac95e129b?panel=Main#
[2017/03/12, 19:15:37] Luc Hayward: can you access the sample programs?
[2017/03/12, 19:15:44] Luc Hayward: there's piss all in the folders for me
[2017/03/12, 19:22:16] Stuart Mesham: Same only empty folders
[2017/03/12, 19:22:27] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/03/12, 19:23:08] Stuart Mesham: Dan told me what python IDE they were told to use but I forgot what it was already 🙈😂
[2017/03/12, 19:23:16] Stuart Mesham: Started with a W I think
[2017/03/12, 19:23:36] Stuart Mesham: I think it's called wing
[2017/03/12, 19:23:42] Luc Hayward: its called wing
[2017/03/12, 19:23:50] Luc Hayward: it looks like its about 324987 years old
[2017/03/12, 19:24:04] Stuart Mesham: Yeah so it's like JGrasp for Python
[2017/03/12, 19:24:21] Luc Hayward: Except it looks so much worse. So so much.
[2017/03/12, 19:24:30] Stuart Mesham: He said he thinks they used Python 3.5 but they'll tell us in lectures
[2017/03/12, 19:24:51] Luc Hayward: they do use python 3.5 you can see it in the resources
[2017/03/12, 19:25:00] Luc Hayward: but obviously I've got the updated version
[2017/03/12, 19:25:02] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it does look really rough 😄
[2017/03/12, 19:25:52] Luc Hayward: ie i have python 2.7.10 which is default in osx
[2017/03/12, 19:27:27] Luc Hayward: and python 3.6
[2017/03/12, 19:28:11] Stuart Mesham: A little off topic but what comedy series can you recommend similar to Silicon Valley? 😄
[2017/03/12, 19:28:38] Stuart Mesham: I'm a bit bored at the moment so would love to try another one
[2017/03/12, 19:28:41] Luc Hayward: uhm
[2017/03/12, 19:28:44] Luc Hayward: i dno
[2017/03/12, 19:28:47] Luc Hayward: im watching suits
[2017/03/12, 19:30:01] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok
[2017/03/12, 19:30:06] Stuart Mesham: Meh
[2017/03/12, 19:30:29] Luc Hayward: we can't have fucking calculators in our tests or exams for maths wtfwtftwtf
[2017/03/12, 19:30:35] Luc Hayward: i dig it
[2017/03/12, 19:30:39] Luc Hayward: i'll think of some more
[2017/03/12, 19:30:41] Luc Hayward: lucifer?
[2017/03/12, 19:30:42] Luc Hayward: friends?
[2017/03/12, 19:31:02] Stuart Mesham: Ah could try those
[2017/03/12, 19:31:11] Luc Hayward: how i met your mother
[2017/03/12, 19:31:45] Stuart Mesham: Thanks I should be well stocked now 😂
[2017/03/12, 19:32:13] Luc Hayward: Ok I’ll think on it. Listen where is the new lecture theatre for maths tomorrow ? And what time are you getting onto campus
[2017/03/12, 19:32:49] Stuart Mesham: I heard it's "South Side"
[2017/03/12, 19:33:04] Stuart Mesham: I think I saw that on the maths chat on Vula 🙈
[2017/03/12, 19:33:23] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna aim for 7:45
[2017/03/12, 19:34:47] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/03/12, 19:34:53] Luc Hayward: aiming for around there too
[2017/03/12, 19:49:43] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/12, 19:49:59] Luc Hayward: major tests
[2017/03/12, 19:50:34] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/03/12, 19:51:32] Luc Hayward: np
[2017/03/12, 19:52:16] Luc Hayward: south side is up on pd hahn side
[2017/03/12, 19:52:40] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/03/12, 19:52:42] Luc Hayward: it is there
[2017/03/12, 19:52:57] Luc Hayward: its the big lecture hall we had most of our talks in like panel discussion
[2017/03/12, 19:55:16] Luc Hayward: i've already written these up
[2017/03/12, 19:55:50] Luc Hayward: but thanks xD
[2017/03/12, 19:55:57] Luc Hayward: i was about to invite you to mine haha
[2017/03/12, 19:58:49] Stuart Mesham: Oh lol
[2017/03/12, 19:58:56] Stuart Mesham: Woops
[2017/03/12, 19:59:28] Luc Hayward: No stress thanks man haha. So no calculators…. Do we even bother taking on to varsity? Probably yeah actually cos of chem
[2017/03/12, 20:00:02] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I still need to buy a calculator because I don't have a silver one
[2017/03/12, 20:00:32] Luc Hayward: Jesus Stuart how? How did you survive AP the silver calculator saves literally 25% off the time spend on pointless shit
[2017/03/12, 20:01:50] Stuart Mesham: I just took Dan's calculator for AP maths exams 😂
[2017/03/12, 20:01:57] Luc Hayward: noice
[2017/03/12, 20:02:13] Luc Hayward: ok i give up i will read all this shit another day
[2017/03/12, 20:02:30] Stuart Mesham: What are you reading?
[2017/03/12, 20:02:51] Luc Hayward: Bio tutorials document, intro to maths
[2017/03/12, 20:03:26] Stuart Mesham: Oh haven't checked bio stuff yet

[2017/03/13, 15:03:29] Luc Hayward: otherwise its in archive if i might need it later but it isnt important in any way
[2017/03/13, 15:03:59] Luc Hayward: bio pracs are up

[2017/03/13, 17:14:41] Luc Hayward: Dear Luc
 
In general textbook authors make only moderate changes between editions.  You should be ok with a 2nd or 3rd edition, though you may find that the chapter/section numbers differ from those given by lecturers. You should be able to find the correct sections by using the index though.

TIL Alexander Hamilton and James Madison both claimed to have written numbers 49-58 and 62-63 of the Federalist Papers. In 1964, a computer analysis of the text revealed that Madison was indeed the author of all 12 of those essays, despite Hamilton's claim to the contrary.

[2017/03/19, 14:46:00] Stuart Mesham: 😂 Will check this later, I don't seem to have enough signal to load the Reddit page 🙈
[2017/03/19, 20:50:26] Stuart Mesham: Remember to be awake and responsive during the chemistry period time tomorrow (then I can do the sign up for you)
[2017/03/19, 20:50:51] Stuart Mesham: Can't even remember what we were signing up for but I think there was something
[2017/03/19, 23:36:30] Luc Hayward: I shall
[2017/03/19, 23:37:08] Luc Hayward: But tomorrow I think ask it is, is that we get told or gross for tutor on Thursday
[2017/03/20, 08:09:34] Stuart Mesham: I'm struggling to interpret that message 😂
[2017/03/20, 09:25:12] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/03/20, 09:25:15] Luc Hayward: Sorry
[2017/03/20, 09:25:18] Luc Hayward: Not sign ups
[2017/03/20, 09:25:25] Luc Hayward: Think we just get told tutor groups
[2017/03/20, 10:10:40] Luc Hayward: Hows Monday going
[2017/03/20, 10:10:48] Luc Hayward: How was chem and maths?
[2017/03/20, 10:11:04] Luc Hayward: Keegan said math was easy?
[2017/03/20, 10:52:36] Stuart Mesham: I didn't go to maths 😄
[2017/03/20, 10:52:54] Stuart Mesham: They didn't pass around any sign up forms in Chem
[2017/03/20, 11:06:38] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/03/20, 11:06:41] Luc Hayward: What really?
[2017/03/20, 11:06:46] Luc Hayward: Oh ok
[2017/03/20, 11:08:29] Luc Hayward: And you  got your prac moved
[2017/03/20, 11:40:04] Luc Hayward: what did we get done/ whaat page did we get to in chem today? has she started anything to do with solubility?
[2017/03/20, 13:12:05] Stuart Mesham: Stoichiometry
[2017/03/20, 13:12:13] Stuart Mesham: Nope no solubility
[2017/03/20, 13:12:31] Luc Hayward: What page did we get to
[2017/03/20, 13:13:11] Stuart Mesham: Yeah what a charming email I must've written 😄
[2017/03/20, 13:13:29] Stuart Mesham: Not sure, I'll check just now
[2017/03/20, 13:13:32] Luc Hayward: gg
[2017/03/20, 13:13:35] Luc Hayward: thanks
[2017/03/20, 13:59:50] Stuart Mesham: Oh crap they're not uploading lecture videos anymore
[2017/03/20, 14:03:52] Luc Hayward: what you mean??
[2017/03/20, 14:04:06] Luc Hayward: they normally take a while to go up
[2017/03/20, 14:06:29] Stuart Mesham: Please ask Keegan if today's maths was the same as 2015 lecture 4
[2017/03/20, 14:07:07] Luc Hayward: Stuart. His notes are up already and they always take until late in the afternoon to go up. Stop stressing out
[2017/03/20, 14:08:40] Stuart Mesham: I saw that none of Friday's​ lectures had been uploaded and after the bio lecture I went and asked our lecturer if they were going no keep uploading lecture videos and he said that some of the lecturers didn't like having their lectures recorded so they've stopped putting them on Vula
[2017/03/20, 14:09:08] Luc Hayward: some
[2017/03/20, 14:09:13] Luc Hayward: some lecturers
[2017/03/20, 14:09:18] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/20, 14:09:20] Luc Hayward: stop stressing
[2017/03/20, 14:09:35] Stuart Mesham: But I have a feeling it's a blanket decision
[2017/03/20, 14:09:38] Stuart Mesham: Like a vote
[2017/03/20, 14:09:58] Stuart Mesham: Friday's lectures still aren't up
[2017/03/20, 14:10:31] Luc Hayward: No its not Stuart. The record ing infrastructure cost the uni tens of thousands of rand to implement they aren’t about to trash it because lecturers are shy
[2017/03/20, 14:10:31] Stuart Mesham: Usually they'd upload them straight away
[2017/03/20, 14:11:15] Stuart Mesham: No it didn't 😂
[2017/03/20, 14:11:43] Luc Hayward: Stu the camera’s alone are like 4 grand each
[2017/03/20, 14:12:11] Stuart Mesham: No they aren't fancy cameras
[2017/03/20, 14:12:59] Stuart Mesham: And I think it's within courses or faculty so they wouldn't trash it for all faculties/courses
[2017/03/20, 14:14:07] Luc Hayward: They’re motion tracking 720p camera’s stu. They are fancy. As is the recording set up in new lecture theatre. Relax. Only bio and Chem aren’t up for Friday or today yet. Maths is all still going up slowly but surely as is comp sci. Don’t panic. Just send Susan an email for Chem and I’m sure dawned or one of the lecturers from bio can tell you there. And if its a problem we record ourselves
[2017/03/20, 14:14:34] Stuart Mesham: Either way, this is what our bio lecturer told us so it's no use trying to deny it 😂
[2017/03/20, 14:23:57] Luc Hayward: Fuck
[2017/03/20, 14:24:05] Luc Hayward: Still that's just bio
[2017/03/20, 14:24:13] Luc Hayward: Doesn't mean anything for the other 3 yet
[2017/03/20, 14:24:23] Luc Hayward: And only some bio Lectures hopeu
[2017/03/20, 14:25:08] Stuart Mesham: Hopefully
[2017/03/20, 14:54:03] Luc Hayward: Please god
[2017/03/20, 15:25:42] Luc Hayward: i cant access the chem tut group doc
[2017/03/20, 15:44:12] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/20, 15:52:41] Stuart Mesham: I think that announcement is specifically talking about the "CS Survival Seminar"
[2017/03/20, 15:53:20] Luc Hayward: yes yes but can you really see cs stuff not being recorded
[2017/03/20, 15:54:23] Stuart Mesham: Dunno, we'll find out
[2017/03/20, 15:54:31] Stuart Mesham: Also you're a noob
[2017/03/20, 15:54:45] Luc Hayward: Eh its not worse than steles. Why??
[2017/03/20, 15:55:15] Stuart Mesham: I installed wing on my laptop today in the CS and it took like 5 minutes to get 3.5 to work 😂
[2017/03/20, 15:55:25] Luc Hayward: 3.5
[2017/03/20, 15:55:34] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/20, 15:55:40] Luc Hayward: i had 3.6.x
[2017/03/20, 15:55:45] Stuart Mesham: Noob
[2017/03/20, 15:55:48] Luc Hayward: 3.5 is easy
[2017/03/20, 15:55:57] Luc Hayward: i had the current version
[2017/03/20, 15:56:24] Stuart Mesham: Noob didn't realise wing doesn't do 3.6 😄
[2017/03/20, 15:56:39] Luc Hayward: i did realise that when i researched it
[2017/03/20, 15:56:46] Luc Hayward: hence i downgraded
[2017/03/20, 15:57:02] Stuart Mesham: Still a n00b
[2017/03/20, 15:57:12] Luc Hayward: also wtf what ide doesnt support new versions
[2017/03/20, 15:57:22] Stuart Mesham: Wing 😂
[2017/03/20, 15:57:55] Stuart Mesham: I don't think wing prides itself on being on the cutting edge
[2017/03/20, 15:58:22] Luc Hayward: its so shit
[2017/03/20, 16:51:12] Stuart Mesham: Thank goodness! They just uploaded the maths lecture! 🎉 It must be just bio
[2017/03/20, 16:54:06] Luc Hayward: Seee
[2017/03/20, 17:50:20] Stuart Mesham: What group doc?
[2017/03/20, 18:08:08] Luc Hayward: Nvm. Good it
[2017/03/20, 18:08:19] Luc Hayward: The PDF that tells us is tut groups
[2017/03/20, 20:01:52] Luc Hayward: stu
[2017/03/20, 20:02:09] Luc Hayward: that maths test on the tenth of april is going to clash with comp sci test 1
[2017/03/20, 20:03:48] Luc Hayward: nevermind
[2017/03/20, 20:03:56] Luc Hayward: i see that comp sci test is actually the 12th
[2017/03/20, 20:20:58] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I did it not delete the comp sci test on your calendar? (I deleted it on mine earlier this afternoon)
[2017/03/20, 20:27:17] Luc Hayward: it does bu it adds/deletes on my personal one, not the uct one. anyway i did it manually. do you think that theres still a bio test on the 12th at 8.....
[2017/03/20, 20:42:51] Stuart Mesham: Oooh the 12th is just a gemors on my calendar 😬
[2017/03/20, 22:55:20] Luc Hayward: Show me
[2017/03/20, 22:55:38] Luc Hayward: We should have identical stuff mostly
[2017/03/21, 10:47:19] Luc Hayward: The recordings from Friday are up
[2017/03/21, 11:37:07] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/21, 12:06:01] Luc Hayward: What's this
[2017/03/21, 12:06:38] Luc Hayward: Also what is happening Friday? With comp sci? Richard Hendrik's said something about no Lecture...
[2017/03/21, 12:09:20] Stuart Mesham: My calendar
[2017/03/21, 12:09:30] Luc Hayward: What is this science test day 1/4
[2017/03/21, 12:09:50] Luc Hayward: Do we get lectures that week?
[2017/03/21, 12:10:00] Stuart Mesham: Came from a PDF or something on the science Vula page
[2017/03/21, 12:10:16] Stuart Mesham: Dunno
[2017/03/21, 12:10:38] Stuart Mesham: Looks like it might be a dedicated test week
[2017/03/21, 12:10:52] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/03/21, 12:10:57] Luc Hayward: That'd be really nice
[2017/03/21, 12:11:31] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it would be so rof if we had lectures 😂
[2017/03/21, 12:30:16] Luc Hayward: And pracs too
[2017/03/21, 12:31:26] Luc Hayward: Ok well in nearly fished the Lectures
[2017/03/22, 07:17:08] Luc Hayward: Send me Daniels number?
[2017/03/22, 07:41:53] Luc Hayward: Stuart why do I have this bio test down so late
[2017/03/22, 07:41:59] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/22, 08:03:40] Luc Hayward: 3 minute late👌

[2017/03/22, 15:48:35] Stuart Mesham: Where are comp sci tutorials?
[2017/03/22, 15:48:47] Luc Hayward: Check venues
[2017/03/22, 15:49:04] Stuart Mesham: Where?
[2017/03/22, 15:50:09] Luc Hayward: Probably in comp sci building
[2017/03/22, 15:50:12] Luc Hayward: Far left
[2017/03/22, 15:50:14] Luc Hayward: Ground floor
[2017/03/22, 15:50:10] Stuart Mesham: Comp Sci block?
[2017/03/22, 15:50:26] Luc Hayward: But else check Vula
[2017/03/22, 15:51:42] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/03/22, 17:25:35] Stuart Mesham: Does your still say "not started" in the assignments tab in comp sci on Vula?
[2017/03/22, 17:25:54] Luc Hayward: Hmm?
[2017/03/22, 17:26:57] Stuart Mesham: Click comp sci, click assignments, look at table
"Status" column?
[2017/03/22, 17:32:27] Luc Hayward: Check grade book
[2017/03/22, 17:32:34] Luc Hayward: What matters is what that tab says
[2017/03/22, 18:31:38] Stuart Mesham: Oh cool my gradebook's fine
[2017/03/22, 18:40:27] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/03/22, 21:49:49] Stuart Mesham: There are apparently no real comp sci student advisors anymore so I had to email Hussein and he was like "umm no." 😄
[2017/03/23, 06:01:35] Luc Hayward: reallyreally?
[2017/03/23, 08:36:49] Luc Hayward: You got cash on you?
[2017/03/23, 10:25:17] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/23, 10:34:22] Stuart Mesham: Remember Chris Hani today
[2017/03/23, 10:42:51] Stuart Mesham: Should we go back, front or middle?
[2017/03/23, 10:46:02] Luc Hayward: Where you
[2017/03/23, 10:47:13] Luc Hayward: Where you at
[2017/03/23, 10:47:24] Luc Hayward: Top middle or bottom
[2017/03/23, 10:48:27] Stuart Mesham: On the right

[2017/03/26, 15:26:13] Luc Hayward: Oi
[2017/03/26, 15:26:19] Luc Hayward: Send me your challenge vodeu
[2017/03/26, 15:26:20] Luc Hayward: Code
[2017/03/26, 15:26:23] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/03/26, 15:26:33] Luc Hayward: I'm confused how they want us to output it
[2017/03/26, 15:29:53] Stuart Mesham: Look at ma bouncyball!!!
[2017/03/26, 15:30:04] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/03/26, 15:30:12] Stuart Mesham: <‎video omitted>
[2017/03/26, 15:30:45] Stuart Mesham: I struggled to hold the camera and aim the mouse
[2017/03/26, 15:30:53] Stuart Mesham: So I missed a few times
[2017/03/26, 15:31:22] Luc Hayward: That's pretty neat
[2017/03/26, 15:31:44] Stuart Mesham: Thank you 😄
[2017/03/26, 15:32:00] Luc Hayward: Can you help me with this challenge thing I'm mildly confused
[2017/03/26, 15:32:27] Stuart Mesham: For the challenge the problem was that the input code reads newlines at the end of each input so your output will include double newlines
[2017/03/26, 15:32:37] Stuart Mesham: You have to trim the newlines off the input
[2017/03/26, 15:32:46] Luc Hayward: Hmmm
[2017/03/26, 15:32:55] Stuart Mesham: That's it 😂
[2017/03/26, 15:33:11] Luc Hayward: Oh I understand
[2017/03/26, 15:33:46] Luc Hayward: So the input is including a new line at the end and so when we read it and then print it normally, it's throwing an extra empty line in?
[2017/03/26, 15:34:44] Stuart Mesham: Yeah because you store that extra newline in your string variable when you get your input
[2017/03/26, 15:35:15] Stuart Mesham: So when you print that string it has a new line in it and then the print function adds it's new line
[2017/03/26, 15:35:21] Luc Hayward: Ah I see
[2017/03/26, 15:35:55] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I also found it infuriating since the automaker doesn't tell you what's wrong 😂
[2017/03/26, 15:36:11] Luc Hayward: Also they've changed print in python 3
[2017/03/26, 15:36:39] Luc Hayward: So python 2 you would just add a comma to the end and it wouldn't put a new line
[2017/03/26, 15:36:53] Luc Hayward: Now we need to use that end='' right?
[2017/03/26, 15:37:46] Stuart Mesham: Well I prefer to get into the habit of trimming the newline off the input because in future challenges it might mess up the actually calculations/program
[2017/03/26, 15:37:54] Stuart Mesham: *actual
[2017/03/26, 15:38:51] Luc Hayward: Yep that didn't work anyway
[2017/03/26, 15:39:09] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/26, 15:39:56] Stuart Mesham: That's a space you fool
[2017/03/26, 15:40:11] Luc Hayward: Oops wrong file
[2017/03/26, 15:40:28] Luc Hayward: I had trimmed out the spaces thinking that might have been it's issue
[2017/03/26, 15:40:37] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/26, 15:40:52] Luc Hayward: That's still causing it issues
[2017/03/26, 15:41:02] Stuart Mesham: Think I did something like that
[2017/03/26, 15:41:17] Stuart Mesham: What does your output in the console look like?
[2017/03/26, 15:41:29] Luc Hayward: If I test that?
[2017/03/26, 15:41:38] Stuart Mesham: No if you click run
[2017/03/26, 15:41:54] Luc Hayward: Nvm it's working now
[2017/03/26, 15:42:08] Luc Hayward: I'd left the whitespace trimming line in
[2017/03/26, 15:42:20] Luc Hayward: And it flipped it's shit and wouldn't accept the last test case
[2017/03/26, 15:43:14] Luc Hayward: It would be nice if it told us what it was looking for more clearly
[2017/03/26, 15:43:44] Luc Hayward: Also leaderboard doesn't update?
[2017/03/26, 15:43:47] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/26, 15:44:04] Stuart Mesham: They said it updates at 6am
[2017/03/26, 15:44:52] Luc Hayward: The leaderboard? Each day?
[2017/03/26, 15:46:11] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/26, 15:46:40] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/03/26, 15:47:00] Luc Hayward: Glad to see I nailed it in the same number of attempts you did(I'm ignoring that I needed help 😂😂)
[2017/03/26, 15:47:21] Stuart Mesham: Am I still on the leaderboard? 😂
[2017/03/26, 15:47:35] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/03/26, 15:47:47] Stuart Mesham: Yeeeah 😎😄
[2017/03/26, 15:47:53] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/26, 15:48:00] Luc Hayward: That's the entire thing
[2017/03/26, 15:48:49] Stuart Mesham: Someone did it in 2 attempts!!
[2017/03/26, 15:51:11] Luc Hayward: Must have had help
[2017/03/26, 15:51:26] Luc Hayward: Nobody could guess that it was adding new lines and would freak out because of it
[2017/03/26, 15:54:40] Luc Hayward: We have pracs this week hey?
[2017/03/26, 16:23:38] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/26, 17:38:17] Luc Hayward: Should be easy
[2017/03/26, 17:58:50] Stuart Mesham: ??? I hope so 😂
[2017/03/26, 17:58:55] Luc Hayward: 😂😂😂😂
[2017/03/26, 17:58:58] Luc Hayward: Watch us fail
[2017/03/26, 17:59:07] Stuart Mesham: We don't have to do anything before the bio prac, do we?
[2017/03/26, 17:59:16] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😄
[2017/03/26, 17:59:27] Luc Hayward: Huh? No? Is this your first or second?
[2017/03/26, 17:59:44] Stuart Mesham: My second is tomorrow
[2017/03/26, 18:00:46] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/03/26, 18:00:53] Luc Hayward: I haven't had my second yet
[2017/03/26, 18:00:54] Luc Hayward: Urm
[2017/03/26, 18:01:07] Luc Hayward: You need to read through the thingy
[2017/03/26, 18:01:21] Luc Hayward: That tells you what to do
[2017/03/26, 18:01:37] Stuart Mesham: On Vula or the prac manual?

[2017/03/26, 18:03:08] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/03/26, 18:05:55] Luc Hayward: My maths tut is tomorrow
[2017/03/26, 18:06:15] Stuart Mesham: Shame
[2017/03/26, 18:06:21] Luc Hayward: When's your comp sci tut
[2017/03/26, 18:06:24] Luc Hayward: Eh
[2017/03/26, 18:06:33] Stuart Mesham: These questions look like a fat mission
[2017/03/26, 18:06:51] Stuart Mesham: Wednesday
[2017/03/26, 18:06:53] Luc Hayward: Havent been having trouble with the maths yet. Will finish it in our frees
[2017/03/26, 18:07:08] Stuart Mesham: Yeah maths is chilled
[2017/03/26, 18:13:33] Luc Hayward: Ok 👌
[2017/03/26, 18:13:46] Luc Hayward: When did she say the challenge questions go up?
[2017/03/26, 18:13:59] Stuart Mesham: Tomorrow morning
[2017/03/26, 18:22:13] Stuart Mesham: All the answers to question 1 are on page 600
[2017/03/26, 19:24:52] Luc Hayward: What???
[2017/03/26, 19:25:03] Luc Hayward: Context Stu
[2017/03/26, 22:11:49] Stuart Mesham: Bio preprac
[2017/03/27, 06:00:31] Luc Hayward: Page 600 of what
[2017/03/27, 08:42:57] Stuart Mesham: My nose won't stop bleeding
[2017/03/27, 08:42:58] Stuart Mesham: Might be there for comp sci
[2017/03/27, 08:44:36] Stuart Mesham: Textbook
[2017/03/27, 08:52:09] Luc Hayward: What??
[2017/03/27, 08:52:17] Luc Hayward: Are you ok?
[2017/03/27, 08:52:51] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'll be fine
[2017/03/27, 08:55:41] Luc Hayward: When will you be in again?
[2017/03/27, 08:56:11] Stuart Mesham: I don't know
[2017/03/27, 08:56:23] Stuart Mesham: Hopefully less than an hour
[2017/03/27, 08:56:29] Luc Hayward: Do you know why you're dying?
[2017/03/27, 08:56:53] Stuart Mesham: No idea it just started in the shower
[2017/03/27, 08:57:34] Luc Hayward: Fun
[2017/03/27, 08:57:37] Stuart Mesham: Must be karma punishing me for wasting water
[2017/03/27, 08:57:56] Stuart Mesham: Overboard punishment though
[2017/03/27, 08:57:59] Luc Hayward: Well I'll grab a second hand out for yoy
[2017/03/27, 08:58:08] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/03/27, 08:58:11] Luc Hayward: From chemistry
[2017/03/27, 08:58:28] Luc Hayward: Ionisation and dissociation
[2017/03/27, 08:58:37] Luc Hayward: Maths was power functions and polynomials
[2017/03/27, 08:58:41] Luc Hayward: Took too long
[2017/03/27, 08:58:41] Stuart Mesham: Ooh
[2017/03/27, 08:59:06] Luc Hayward: And was wayyy to complex as normal. Lots of formal definitions that are easier to explain with words
[2017/03/27, 08:59:47] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool 👌🏻 still easy to catch up
[2017/03/27, 09:01:30] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/03/27, 09:01:54] Luc Hayward: And. Chemistry she fucked up and realised we have one lecture instead of two left in this section.
[2017/03/27, 09:02:34] Stuart Mesham: Oh no
[2017/03/27, 09:03:10] Stuart Mesham: But it's fine isn't it school stuff?
[2017/03/27, 09:06:21] Luc Hayward: Mostly yeah I think so
[2017/03/27, 09:11:37] Stuart Mesham: Should be fine
[2017/03/27, 09:12:42] Luc Hayward: Nothing new yet
[2017/03/27, 09:18:33] Stuart Mesham: In my calendar I've got a thing saying "no bio prac today" and I have no idea where it came from 😂
[2017/03/27, 09:18:57] Luc Hayward: Hmmm
[2017/03/27, 09:19:01] Luc Hayward: Maybe?
[2017/03/27, 09:19:01] Stuart Mesham: Could've been an email or a course outline thing
[2017/03/27, 09:19:06] Luc Hayward: Check course outline
[2017/03/27, 09:19:20] Luc Hayward: I didn't have a prac last week
[2017/03/27, 09:19:39] Stuart Mesham: Me neither because of the holiday
[2017/03/27, 09:22:28] Luc Hayward: But I think we do this week....
[2017/03/27, 09:23:33] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/27, 09:23:39] Luc Hayward: Definitely have hem this week
[2017/03/27, 09:23:43] Stuart Mesham: On the 17th of March there was an announcement saying no bio pracs next week but that was 2 weeks ago
[2017/03/27, 09:24:32] Luc Hayward: Nah defs pracs this week
[2017/03/27, 09:24:45] Luc Hayward: Rather go and be turned away than not go and news up
[2017/03/27, 09:24:47] Luc Hayward: Mess
[2017/03/27, 09:25:14] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it was probably from that announcement and then I put it on the wrong week
[2017/03/27, 09:27:04] Luc Hayward: 👌
[2017/03/27, 10:03:50] Stuart Mesham: I'm healed
[2017/03/27, 10:04:10] Stuart Mesham: I'm alive
[2017/03/27, 10:04:14] Luc Hayward: Lad. Can a function be both even and odd at the same time
[2017/03/27, 10:04:33] Stuart Mesham: Doesn't sound good
[2017/03/27, 10:05:41] Stuart Mesham: I think it's either even, odd or neither
[2017/03/27, 10:05:55] Luc Hayward: Ok.
[2017/03/27, 10:06:21] Stuart Mesham: Like x^2 + x + 1 is neither, right?
[2017/03/27, 10:07:10] Stuart Mesham: Neither or both?
[2017/03/27, 10:07:18] Luc Hayward: I'll check
[2017/03/27, 10:07:35] Luc Hayward: It's not even
[2017/03/27, 10:07:51] Luc Hayward: Nor is it odd
[2017/03/27, 10:07:57] Stuart Mesham: Because it has even and odd powers of x but the function doesn't have the characteristics of odd functions or even functions
[2017/03/27, 10:08:06] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/03/27, 10:08:29] Stuart Mesham: Ok then I come to this conclusion 😄
[2017/03/27, 10:08:39] Luc Hayward: What is the difference between an algebraic and rational function???
[2017/03/27, 10:08:53] Stuart Mesham: Err
[2017/03/27, 10:08:56] Stuart Mesham: Wut
[2017/03/27, 10:09:04] Luc Hayward: Exactly
[2017/03/27, 10:09:10] Stuart Mesham: Algebraic can have i?
[2017/03/27, 10:09:13] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/27, 10:09:51] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/03/27, 10:10:02] Luc Hayward: A is root
[2017/03/27, 10:10:07] Luc Hayward: Sorry b is root
[2017/03/27, 10:10:09] Luc Hayward: A is log
[2017/03/27, 10:10:19] Luc Hayward: C is polynomial
[2017/03/27, 10:10:23] Stuart Mesham: Maybe rational functions do not have π or other irrational numbers in them
[2017/03/27, 10:10:31] Luc Hayward: D is algebraic??
[2017/03/27, 10:10:35] Luc Hayward: Ohhh yes maybe
[2017/03/27, 10:10:36] Stuart Mesham: Don't they give you the answers?
[2017/03/27, 10:10:47] Luc Hayward: No this is this week's tut
[2017/03/27, 10:11:09] Luc Hayward: And I'm on my phone instead of hauling out laptop
[2017/03/27, 10:11:18] Stuart Mesham: But the textbook
[2017/03/27, 10:11:51] Stuart Mesham: I just tried to do a comp sci challenge question
[2017/03/27, 10:12:15] Stuart Mesham: The automarker is harrassing me again
[2017/03/27, 10:12:31] Stuart Mesham: 2 attempts down the line and I still get 0
[2017/03/27, 10:12:32] Luc Hayward: Come to the library and work with mev
[2017/03/27, 10:12:37] Luc Hayward: Second floor
[2017/03/27, 10:12:40] Luc Hayward: Third floor
[2017/03/27, 10:12:53] Stuart Mesham: I'll come with my tissue box
[2017/03/27, 10:12:58] Luc Hayward: Yeah do that
[2017/03/27, 10:13:24] Luc Hayward: And then I'll start with you on the challenges in comp sci if I finish the red maths questions
[2017/03/27, 10:13:34] Stuart Mesham: Do you recommend a warm top or will I end up carrying it around? (it's freezing here in my room)
[2017/03/27, 10:13:43] Luc Hayward: Nah you don't need one
[2017/03/27, 10:13:50] Luc Hayward: Being inside is warm
[2017/03/27, 10:13:58] Luc Hayward: Only outside is a bit chilled
[2017/03/27, 10:14:19] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool (every time I've brought a warm top I've always taken it off)
[2017/03/27, 10:40:24] Stuart Mesham: Did you leave?
[2017/03/27, 10:41:49] Luc Hayward: Not yet
[2017/03/27, 10:42:00] Luc Hayward: But packing
[2017/03/27, 10:43:33] Luc Hayward: Leaving now why?
[2017/03/27, 10:43:36] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm going there now
[2017/03/27, 10:43:44] Stuart Mesham: Chris Hani
[2017/03/27, 10:43:46] Luc Hayward: Just meet me at comp sci
[2017/03/27, 10:44:31] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/27, 10:44:50] Luc Hayward: Where inside
[2017/03/27, 10:46:34] Luc Hayward: Up or down
[2017/03/27, 13:28:59] Luc Hayward: Stuart
[2017/03/27, 13:29:02] Luc Hayward: Send me your code
[2017/03/27, 13:29:09] Luc Hayward: Mine is the same and it's not working wtf
[2017/03/27, 13:29:24] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/27, 15:45:02] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/27, 16:55:34] Luc Hayward: I'm going to murder someone over these polynomial divisions. I can't get them right. I keeo getting the remainder wrong half the time
[2017/03/27, 16:55:34] Luc Hayward: Please look at (c) of the last question?
[2017/03/27, 16:55:34] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/27, 16:55:34] Luc Hayward: Just cannot get that to become what my friend Nic has
[2017/03/27, 16:55:34] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/27, 17:20:59] Luc Hayward: Nvm
[2017/03/27, 17:21:03] Luc Hayward: Nic was an idiot
[2017/03/27, 17:21:05] Luc Hayward: But
[2017/03/27, 17:24:22] Luc Hayward: Please send me your code? I swear my code is identical but I CAnt get it to mark
[2017/03/27, 19:22:53] Stuart Mesham: You double tabbed print English
[2017/03/27, 20:05:31] Luc Hayward: Of ffs
[2017/03/27, 20:05:55] Luc Hayward: Hope that's all
[2017/03/27, 20:40:02] Stuart Mesham: Is there anything to do before a chemistry prac?
[2017/03/27, 20:40:18] Luc Hayward: Not today
[2017/03/27, 20:40:30] Stuart Mesham: Mine is tomorrow
[2017/03/27, 20:40:38] Luc Hayward: Not this first one
[2017/03/27, 20:40:47] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool
[2017/03/27, 20:57:14] Luc Hayward: So
[2017/03/27, 20:57:17] Luc Hayward: It's still won't
[2017/03/27, 20:57:22] Luc Hayward: Accept the code
[2017/03/27, 20:57:31] Luc Hayward: Please send me yours
[2017/03/27, 20:57:38] Luc Hayward: Or try submit mine
[2017/03/27, 20:57:50] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/27, 21:01:49] Luc Hayward: Pretty certain it's not a name error like you had
[2017/03/27, 21:13:14] Stuart Mesham: Ha you spelt unknown wrong 😄
[2017/03/27, 21:15:43] Luc Hayward: Fuck me sideways
[2017/03/27, 21:17:00] Luc Hayward: Good spotting
[2017/03/27, 21:17:05] Luc Hayward: See you tomorrow
[2017/03/27, 21:17:22] Luc Hayward: Gonna do that third one in class with you if you didn't already finish
[2017/03/27, 21:17:34] Stuart Mesham: That's why I always copy and paste the output from the questions 😂
[2017/03/27, 21:18:10] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna see do it now and then just go to sleep if I don't get it first try 😄
[2017/03/27, 21:18:34] Stuart Mesham: I feel like I know the way of the automarker now
[2017/03/27, 21:18:36] Luc Hayward: Ugh I'm rather sleeping now
[2017/03/27, 21:18:45] Luc Hayward: Gives me something to stare at tomorrow
[2017/03/27, 21:18:51] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/03/27, 21:18:56] Stuart Mesham: See you tomorrow
[2017/03/27, 21:50:17] Stuart Mesham: First try 🎉😎😄
[2017/03/27, 21:50:46] Stuart Mesham: Damn I spent half an hour on that 😂
[2017/03/28, 06:01:50] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/03/28, 06:01:54] Luc Hayward: I saw
[2017/03/28, 06:02:00] Luc Hayward: Hence I slept 😂
[2017/03/28, 07:43:34] Stuart Mesham: FUCK me sideways my nose started bleeding again and its worse than yesterday
[2017/03/28, 07:43:47] Luc Hayward: You should see a doctor
[2017/03/28, 07:43:52] Luc Hayward: Don't turn into chris
[2017/03/28, 07:44:08] Stuart Mesham: I should this is infuriating
[2017/03/28, 08:58:37] Luc Hayward: Will you be in today
[2017/03/28, 08:59:26] Stuart Mesham: Probably same as yesterday
[2017/03/28, 08:59:44] Stuart Mesham: I'll get there for comp sci
[2017/03/28, 09:00:31] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/03/28, 09:00:42] Luc Hayward: You should see a doctor
[2017/03/28, 09:01:07] Stuart Mesham: I know, this is awful
[2017/03/28, 09:01:17] Luc Hayward: You're missing stuff in chem again
[2017/03/28, 09:01:22] Luc Hayward: We have a new set of notes
[2017/03/28, 09:01:24] Stuart Mesham: And probably bad for me
[2017/03/28, 09:01:44] Stuart Mesham: Can you get one for me please?
[2017/03/28, 09:01:49] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/03/28, 09:02:01] Luc Hayward: Physical inorganic chemistry. 3 lecture, 1 tut
[2017/03/28, 09:02:05] Stuart Mesham: Thanks!
[2017/03/28, 09:02:25] Stuart Mesham: Oh crap
[2017/03/28, 09:07:36] Luc Hayward: And he wants you to make your own notes
[2017/03/28, 09:08:32] Stuart Mesham: I'm going to watch todays lectures tonight and do that
[2017/03/28, 09:08:56] Stuart Mesham: He didn't let you get another one?
[2017/03/28, 09:18:37] Luc Hayward: No like he makes us all take notes
[2017/03/28, 09:18:48] Luc Hayward: He gave us crap skeleton notes and said add your own
[2017/03/28, 09:19:03] Luc Hayward: And he works like a fucking demon. He's so fast
[2017/03/28, 09:19:21] Stuart Mesham: Oh no
[2017/03/28, 09:22:02] Luc Hayward: It would be much easier if we had all his slides
[2017/03/28, 09:22:15] Luc Hayward: But he showed the sides for each of ours
[2017/03/28, 09:22:30] Luc Hayward: Showed three slides*
[2017/03/28, 10:00:22] Stuart Mesham: Rof
[2017/03/28, 10:05:09] Luc Hayward: He records
[2017/03/28, 10:05:20] Luc Hayward: He said ever chemistry lecture will be recorded
[2017/03/28, 10:36:23] Luc Hayward: I'm in the bio library
[2017/03/28, 10:48:26] Luc Hayward: Where you at
[2017/03/28, 11:45:16] Luc Hayward: You alive?
[2017/03/28, 11:49:59] Stuart Mesham: I'm alive
[2017/03/28, 18:07:41] Luc Hayward: So I didn't realise this but every wrong submission loses you a point in these challenge programs
[2017/03/28, 18:33:39] Stuart Mesham: Oh damn that means I lost a whole lot of points on problem a for naming my file wrong 🙈
[2017/03/28, 18:34:16] Stuart Mesham: Is f(x)=x+2 a root function?
[2017/03/28, 18:37:11] Stuart Mesham: Why is c polynomial?
[2017/03/28, 18:38:02] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/28, 18:59:16] Stuart Mesham: So that means it's rational but not polynomial?
[2017/03/28, 19:00:08] Luc Hayward: Hmmm
[2017/03/28, 19:00:39] Luc Hayward: Nope you're looking at this
[2017/03/28, 19:00:54] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/28, 19:01:07] Luc Hayward: I've lost 6 so far
[2017/03/28, 19:01:42] Luc Hayward: No f(x)=x+2 would be linear (polynomial)
[2017/03/28, 19:01:56] Stuart Mesham: Where do you see 2 points?
[2017/03/28, 19:02:08] Stuart Mesham: 98?
[2017/03/28, 19:02:34] Stuart Mesham: And this?
[2017/03/28, 19:02:46] Luc Hayward: Ok this is a rational because rational we defined as any f(x)=p(x)/q(x) such that p and q are polynomials
[2017/03/28, 19:03:30] Luc Hayward: Yes. Also I can see that it thinks you did a b and c in 3, 1 and 1 tries respectively
[2017/03/28, 19:03:41] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/03/28, 19:04:56] Stuart Mesham: I did (just checked the automarker thing)
[2017/03/28, 19:53:29] Stuart Mesham: Is 0^-1 undefined?
[2017/03/28, 20:10:44] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/03/28, 20:11:42] Stuart Mesham: Shot bru
[2017/03/28, 20:20:02] Luc Hayward: 👌
[2017/03/28, 20:20:25] Luc Hayward: Stuart how is 1/0 not undefined😂 try come to maths tomorrow eh?
[2017/03/28, 20:25:02] Stuart Mesham: Question 1 on the second last page is such a mission
[2017/03/28, 20:25:08] Luc Hayward: Show
[2017/03/28, 20:27:00] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/28, 20:36:46] Luc Hayward: Oh it's a hoe
[2017/03/28, 20:36:49] Luc Hayward: Just understand it
[2017/03/28, 20:36:54] Luc Hayward: Don't bother to draw the graoh
[2017/03/28, 20:38:48] Stuart Mesham: No that wasn't happening
[2017/03/28, 20:39:04] Stuart Mesham: The whole tutorials optional so I opt out of the graphs 😄
[2017/03/28, 20:39:44] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/03/29, 07:11:20] Stuart Mesham: I'm not going to make maths but I'll try just show up tissues and all for Chem 😬
[2017/03/29, 07:14:42] Luc Hayward: Wow
[2017/03/29, 07:15:42] Stuart Mesham: Since 3:30 😬
[2017/03/29, 07:47:10] Luc Hayward: Please

[2017/03/29, 07:47:13] Luc Hayward: A
[2017/03/29, 07:47:15] Luc Hayward: Doctor
[2017/03/29, 07:49:15] Stuart Mesham: It's on my to-do list
[2017/03/29, 07:49:47] Stuart Mesham: It's priority is getting higher every day
[2017/03/29, 07:54:12] Luc Hayward: Yeah.....
[2017/03/29, 08:38:52] Luc Hayward: Are you here
[2017/03/29, 08:39:26] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/03/29, 08:39:34] Stuart Mesham: RIP me
[2017/03/29, 08:39:38] Stuart Mesham: It's still really bad
[2017/03/29, 08:39:47] Luc Hayward: Please go to a doctor
[2017/03/29, 08:39:58] Luc Hayward: Itts not healthy
[2017/03/29, 08:40:16] Luc Hayward: Especially if it's new, then it really should be checked
[2017/03/29, 08:40:22] Luc Hayward: Either a gp or an ent
[2017/03/29, 08:40:26] Stuart Mesham: I know 😂
[2017/03/29, 08:41:05] Stuart Mesham: Oh no it's not new
[2017/03/29, 08:41:16] Stuart Mesham: It's seasonal
[2017/03/29, 08:41:54] Luc Hayward: Really?
[2017/03/29, 08:42:33] Stuart Mesham: Yeah dry air really triggers me
[2017/03/29, 08:42:46] Luc Hayward: Vaseline
[2017/03/29, 08:42:55] Stuart Mesham: I get so offended my nose starts bleeding
[2017/03/29, 08:43:29] Stuart Mesham: Vaseline is a preventative measure 😄
[2017/03/29, 08:43:48] Stuart Mesham: It's too late...
[2017/03/29, 10:34:36] Luc Hayward: GB where you at
[2017/03/29, 10:35:30] Stuart Mesham: Still in my room
[2017/03/29, 10:35:59] Stuart Mesham: It's still going 😐
[2017/03/29, 10:36:07] Luc Hayward: Dude
[2017/03/29, 10:36:15] Luc Hayward: You can't miss a week of lectures
[2017/03/29, 10:36:25] Stuart Mesham: I know
[2017/03/29, 10:37:19] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna try very hard to make bio at least
[2017/03/29, 10:37:46] Luc Hayward: Not worth it
[2017/03/29, 10:38:00] Luc Hayward: Don't you have pracs or Tut's
[2017/03/29, 10:38:15] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/29, 10:38:21] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/03/29, 10:39:23] Stuart Mesham: Comp sci is definitely not worth the struggle but bio maybe unless she just reads the powerpoint again
[2017/03/29, 10:39:51] Stuart Mesham: I've got my maths tut
[2017/03/29, 10:39:58] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/03/29, 10:40:05] Stuart Mesham: Same as you right?
[2017/03/29, 10:40:13] Luc Hayward: Nah bio prac
[2017/03/29, 10:40:30] Stuart Mesham: And then the comp sci prac test
[2017/03/29, 10:40:50] Luc Hayward: Nah I have my bio tut today with the prac
[2017/03/29, 10:41:59] Stuart Mesham: Do you remember whether she finished the powerpoint yesterday?
[2017/03/29, 10:42:22] Luc Hayward: Don't think so
[2017/03/29, 10:46:49] Stuart Mesham: Ok then unless it gets drastically better I'm not gonna go to bio
[2017/03/29, 10:49:16] Luc Hayward: May as well study visa unisa
[2017/03/29, 10:53:04] Stuart Mesham: True but UCT would probably still be better 😂
[2017/03/29, 11:20:56] Stuart Mesham: Ok so the bleeding has slowed down
[2017/03/29, 11:20:57] Stuart Mesham: Time to make my pilgrimage
[2017/03/29, 11:57:45] Luc Hayward: You here?
[2017/03/29, 12:10:23] Stuart Mesham: No, that didn't work out in the end
[2017/03/29, 12:10:40] Stuart Mesham: I got to the Jammy stop and then my nose decided for me
[2017/03/29, 12:12:22] Luc Hayward: Nice

[2017/03/29, 12:12:38] Luc Hayward: We're doing acid rain
[2017/03/29, 12:13:23] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/03/29, 12:13:43] Stuart Mesham: Oh dear
[2017/03/29, 12:29:33] Stuart Mesham: Booked a doctor's appointment tomorrow
[2017/03/29, 12:29:41] Luc Hayward: Good thing
[2017/03/29, 12:29:48] Luc Hayward: No bleeding in my car. 👌👌
[2017/03/29, 12:30:02] Stuart Mesham: Sure thing 😂
[2017/03/29, 12:30:08] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/03/29, 12:44:59] Luc Hayward: You missed out today
[2017/03/29, 13:16:25] Stuart Mesham: You mean on the protests?
[2017/03/29, 13:16:26] Stuart Mesham: Or on the acid rain?
[2017/03/29, 13:18:21] Luc Hayward: On like organic molecules
[2017/03/29, 13:18:25] Luc Hayward: And the different isomers
[2017/03/29, 13:18:38] Luc Hayward: And special L and D isomers thingys
[2017/03/29, 13:18:58] Stuart Mesham: Chem?
[2017/03/29, 13:19:08] Luc Hayward: Nah bio
[2017/03/29, 17:13:37] Stuart Mesham: For chem tut 2 question 2 isn't there no information about temperature because movement/speed isn't indicated
[2017/03/29, 17:31:24] Luc Hayward: Huh?
[2017/03/29, 19:33:26] Stuart Mesham: You can only see the number of molecules and not how fast they're moving
[2017/03/29, 19:39:29] Luc Hayward: Show me
[2017/03/29, 19:39:58] Stuart Mesham: https://vula.uct.ac.za/access/content/group/c2ca627c-a05d-46bc-aaaa-4771cd2cb7da/Tutorials/CEM1000W%20Tutorial%2002_2017.pdf
[2017/03/29, 19:40:01] Stuart Mesham: q2
[2017/03/29, 19:40:09] Stuart Mesham: big picture
[2017/03/29, 19:40:20] Luc Hayward: No man show me pictures in on mobile
[2017/03/29, 19:40:42] Stuart Mesham: Fine.
[2017/03/29, 19:40:49] Stuart Mesham: If I have to
[2017/03/29, 19:41:52] Stuart Mesham: iPhones can't even open PDFs 😒
[2017/03/29, 19:41:59] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/29, 19:44:28] Stuart Mesham: What section (so I can look it up in the textbook) did you do in bio?
[2017/03/29, 19:45:07] Luc Hayward: Not a clue. I'll show you tomorrow
[2017/03/29, 19:45:24] Stuart Mesham: But then it'll be too late!
[2017/03/29, 19:45:29] Luc Hayward: I can I just don't want to have to type in my password
[2017/03/29, 19:45:41] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/03/29, 19:45:43] Luc Hayward: Well
[2017/03/29, 19:45:54] Stuart Mesham: Give me a keyword to search
[2017/03/29, 19:45:58] Luc Hayward: We started a new slideshow maybe it's on Vila?
[2017/03/29, 19:46:03] Luc Hayward: It's on isomers
[2017/03/29, 19:46:08] Stuart Mesham: I have a PDF of the textbook
[2017/03/29, 19:46:18] Stuart Mesham: Critic acid cycle?
[2017/03/29, 19:46:49] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/03/29, 19:46:52] Luc Hayward: Isomers
[2017/03/29, 19:47:00] Stuart Mesham: Ibuprofen
[2017/03/29, 19:47:13] Luc Hayward: CO2 and water
[2017/03/29, 19:47:27] Luc Hayward: Yeah ibuprofen came up
[2017/03/29, 19:47:56] Stuart Mesham: cis-trans isomers
[2017/03/29, 19:49:29] Stuart Mesham: Not synthesis and breakdown of polymers?
[2017/03/29, 19:49:39] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/03/29, 19:49:40] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/03/29, 19:49:48] Luc Hayward: The isomer one
[2017/03/29, 19:49:55] Stuart Mesham: Ok I think I got the chapter in the textbook
[2017/03/29, 19:51:00] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/29, 19:51:04] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/29, 19:51:11] Stuart Mesham: Does this stuff look familiar?
[2017/03/29, 19:55:14] Luc Hayward: Yeah it's that
[2017/03/29, 19:55:30] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/03/29, 19:56:19] Luc Hayward: 4.3 is too far
[2017/03/29, 19:57:53] Stuart Mesham: Perfect 👌🏻
[2017/03/29, 22:26:01] Stuart Mesham: Hey Luc, I'm gonna stay at home tomorrow afternoon/night. Do you want to load my camping stuff into your car tomorrow afternoon from my house (earlier than 4 or after 5:30 because of doctor's appointment) or on Friday from res after lectures?
[2017/03/29, 22:26:24] Stuart Mesham: Just realized the "hey Luc" was probably not necessary
[2017/03/29, 22:26:59] Stuart Mesham: I was getting ready to write a long message so it seemed needed somehow
[2017/03/30, 05:52:06] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/03/30, 05:52:14] Luc Hayward: I'll get it today if you like
[2017/03/30, 05:52:45] Luc Hayward: I end at 5ish
[2017/03/30, 05:52:55] Luc Hayward: So if I get to your house after 5:30 then today
[2017/03/30, 05:52:58] Luc Hayward: Else tomorrow
[2017/03/30, 05:53:08] Luc Hayward: Whatever is easier
[2017/03/30, 06:50:17] Luc Hayward: But if it's already packed, surely Dan can give it to me if you aren't home yet?
[2017/03/30, 09:46:17] Luc Hayward: I'm in the bio library
[2017/03/30, 16:01:31] Luc Hayward: I'm on my way
[2017/03/30, 16:03:27] Stuart Mesham: Ok I've just left for the doctor but I made a pile of stuff by the front door
[2017/03/30, 16:03:32] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/03/30, 16:07:16] Stuart Mesham: The only things that aren't in the pile are a mattress pump and the chairs
[2017/03/30, 16:07:42] Luc Hayward: I have a mattress pump (hand pump)
[2017/03/30, 16:07:51] Luc Hayward: I'll ask for chairs
[2017/03/30, 16:08:03] Stuart Mesham: The chairs are in the garage (on top of the cupboard furthest from the house side)
[2017/03/30, 16:08:08] Stuart Mesham: Cool
[2017/03/30, 16:09:22] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/30, 16:10:11] Stuart Mesham: Ok Lexie and Linda should be there
[2017/03/30, 16:11:05] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/30, 16:22:44] Luc Hayward: Stu you know you have more stuff than Hol and I combined
[2017/03/30, 16:37:57] Stuart Mesham: Sorry! Mom got involved 😄
[2017/03/30, 16:38:12] Stuart Mesham: You still there?
[2017/03/30, 16:38:20] Stuart Mesham: I'm on my way back
[2017/03/30, 16:40:13] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/03/30, 16:41:20] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool
[2017/03/30, 16:41:20] Stuart Mesham: Hope Boyd fits 😂
[2017/03/30, 16:41:50] Luc Hayward: He will
[2017/03/30, 16:42:13] Luc Hayward: Everything has to fit in the boot or on the middle part of the back seat
[2017/03/30, 16:42:37] Stuart Mesham: Yeah we'll be fine
[2017/03/30, 21:21:17] Stuart Mesham: How much is the Beaverlac fee?
[2017/03/30, 21:23:49] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/03/30, 21:24:24] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/03/30, 21:25:16] Luc Hayward: 👍
[2017/03/30, 21:25:41] Luc Hayward: Listen we need to swing via Sonya to drop the 8 man and some food and the chairs off so that we all fit and I can see enough to drive safely
[2017/03/30, 21:25:56] Luc Hayward: So you and I are going to head out of our bio lecture fast to skip traffic
[2017/03/30, 21:27:53] Stuart Mesham: Why don't we drop the tent off with Lloyd in Stellenbosch? (He's got a whole car to himself)
[2017/03/30, 21:33:24] Luc Hayward: Because there literally is not space for me to see with it if we also put holly and boyds bags in
[2017/03/30, 21:33:35] Luc Hayward: I tried
[2017/03/30, 21:33:48] Luc Hayward: It 109%  won't work
[2017/03/30, 21:33:55] Luc Hayward: So we're going to give it to sonya
[2017/03/30, 21:34:03] Luc Hayward: And it can go in the kombi
[2017/03/30, 21:44:28] Stuart Mesham: So why not Nic's house if it can go in the Kombi?
[2017/03/30, 21:44:48] Luc Hayward: I suppose we can do that ? I don't know where he lives
[2017/03/30, 21:45:01] Stuart Mesham: He lives close to UCT
[2017/03/30, 21:45:07] Luc Hayward: Oh ok
[2017/03/30, 21:45:07] Stuart Mesham: He said 15 minute walk
[2017/03/30, 21:45:18] Stuart Mesham: So about as far as Kopano
[2017/03/30, 21:45:34] Luc Hayward: I'll ask of we can
[2017/03/30, 21:46:55] Stuart Mesham: Lunch in Stellenbosch tomorrow?
[2017/03/30, 21:47:03] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/03/30, 21:47:14] Luc Hayward: Straight on through
[2017/03/30, 21:47:19] Luc Hayward: Lunch on the road
[2017/03/30, 21:48:19] Stuart Mesham: I don't want to carry lunch around to all our lectures 😂
[2017/03/30, 21:48:26] Stuart Mesham: Drive through? 😄
[2017/03/30, 21:48:46] Luc Hayward: Yeah..... Wimpy or steers at the petrol station
[2017/03/30, 21:48:49] Luc Hayward: Obviously
[2017/03/30, 21:49:06] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/03/30, 21:49:18] Luc Hayward: 👍
[2017/03/31, 08:05:54] Luc Hayward: http://www.techspot.com/news/68728-official-trailer-silicon-valley-season-4-has-arrived.html

[2017/03/31, 10:24:39] Stuart Mesham: Naas bru 👌🏻😄
[2017/03/31, 10:29:05] Luc Hayward: apparently some people were having troubles with the last question on it xD
[2017/03/31, 11:07:32] Stuart Mesham: We must be too clever for comp sci
[2017/04/03, 08:22:32] Luc Hayward: You here today?
[2017/04/03, 08:44:12] Luc Hayward: This is such a cool idea. One picture editable by anyone and repeatedly saved so that a history exists.

[2017/04/03, 08:58:46] Stuart Mesham: Where are you?
[2017/04/03, 08:58:51] Luc Hayward: If I had seen that before so sat down I'd have joined you. 👎
[2017/04/03, 08:59:02] Luc Hayward: Look right and two rows up if you can
[2017/04/03, 08:59:12] Luc Hayward: All the way on the right of the middle section
[2017/04/03, 08:59:26] Stuart Mesham: Is there a seat there for me?
[2017/04/03, 08:59:42] Luc Hayward: Come to library with me after this ? Or are you going to physics
[2017/04/03, 08:59:44] Luc Hayward: Nah
[2017/04/03, 08:59:45] Luc Hayward: Full
[2017/04/03, 08:59:51] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/04/03, 08:59:59] Stuart Mesham: Nah I'm going to physics soz 😂
[2017/04/03, 09:00:17] Luc Hayward: Stu😂
[2017/04/03, 09:00:31] Luc Hayward: Have you finished chem or maths tut?
[2017/04/03, 09:00:31] Stuart Mesham: It's such a vibe 😄
[2017/04/03, 09:00:37] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/04/03, 09:00:59] Stuart Mesham: I've done my bio pre-prac stuff so I'm all good 👌🏻
[2017/04/03, 09:01:15] Luc Hayward: Ah you have bio today

[2017/04/03, 10:58:35] Stuart Mesham: I thought you were gonna bunk 😂
[2017/04/03, 10:58:49] Luc Hayward: I may as well go work on maths rather than sit here with nobody to talk to
[2017/04/03, 10:59:02] Luc Hayward: 😂 you have a phone just ask
[2017/04/03, 10:59:23] Stuart Mesham: Are you leaving now?
[2017/04/03, 10:59:50] Luc Hayward: Maybe
[2017/04/03, 11:00:02] Luc Hayward: I mean is this with it when we have a maths tut
[2017/04/03, 11:00:04] Stuart Mesham: Actually let's leave now

[2017/04/03, 20:27:58] Stuart Mesham: What do we actually have to do for chemistry pre-prac?
[2017/04/03, 20:28:15] Stuart Mesham: I don't see "draw a flowchart" anywhere
[2017/04/03, 20:28:23] Stuart Mesham: It just says read stuff
[2017/04/04, 05:56:45] Luc Hayward: Always follow chat if prac report
[2017/04/04, 08:07:04] Luc Hayward: Hows the rain

[2017/04/04, 10:49:43] Stuart Mesham: I'll wait here
[2017/04/04, 17:26:13] Luc Hayward: please link me the textbooks
[2017/04/04, 18:53:21] Stuart Mesham: Don't have my laptop with me right now, will do when I get back to res 👍🏻
[2017/04/04, 18:53:36] Luc Hayward: shot
[2017/04/04, 18:53:39] Luc Hayward: where you?
[2017/04/04, 18:53:45] Stuart Mesham: Do you need them now or would it be easier to just airdrop tomorrow?
[2017/04/04, 18:54:04] Stuart Mesham: I came home for the evening for a brithday dinner
[2017/04/04, 18:54:05] Luc Hayward: tomorrow
[2017/04/04, 18:54:11] Luc Hayward: noic
[2017/04/04, 18:54:13] Luc Hayward: enjoy
[2017/04/04, 18:54:26] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'll just airdrop when I see you 👍🏻
[2017/04/04, 18:54:34] Luc Hayward: perfect
[2017/04/05, 07:28:49] Luc Hayward: Bring me your bio practical thing
[2017/04/05, 07:30:38] Luc Hayward: Like the practical booklet that tells us what to do
[2017/04/05, 10:47:32] Luc Hayward: Where your
[2017/04/05, 10:48:59] Luc Hayward: You going today?
[2017/04/05, 10:50:48] Luc Hayward: Mate
[2017/04/05, 11:08:04] Stuart Mesham: I'm working on my Chem prac
[2017/04/05, 11:08:11] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/04/05, 11:08:48] Luc Hayward: Ok😂
[2017/04/05, 11:21:14] Luc Hayward: Richard just ran into the first problem with teaching python first(ie a dynamic language not a typed one)
[2017/04/05, 11:21:48] Luc Hayward: He now has to explain strings vs numbers 😂 and why types make a difference
[2017/04/05, 11:44:11] Luc Hayward: Where you now?
[2017/04/05, 11:51:25] Stuart Mesham: Yay and lol 😂
[2017/04/05, 11:51:37] Stuart Mesham: I'm about to leave the bio library
[2017/04/05, 11:51:49] Luc Hayward: Come I'm keeping a seat youre late😂
[2017/04/05, 11:52:13] Stuart Mesham: Ok see you now 😂
[2017/04/05, 11:55:33] Luc Hayward: Starting to put slides up
[2017/04/05, 11:55:37] Luc Hayward: Taking out chalk
[2017/04/05, 18:12:43] Luc Hayward: finished chem tutu???
[2017/04/05, 18:43:05] Stuart Mesham: Just starting question 4
[2017/04/05, 18:43:21] Luc Hayward: Ok guess I’ll check in tut\
[2017/04/05, 18:44:06] Stuart Mesham: Wot
[2017/04/05, 18:59:31] Luc Hayward: was gonna ask about a few of them but i think i worked it out
[2017/04/05, 19:04:54] Stuart Mesham: I'm pretty sure my answers are wrong because I'm just kinda winging it 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/04/05, 19:05:11] Stuart Mesham: It's my own interpretation of the questions 😄
[2017/04/05, 19:05:19] Luc Hayward: yep same
[2017/04/05, 19:05:24] Stuart Mesham: What were your answers for 3 and 4?
[2017/04/05, 19:05:29] Luc Hayward: for the first few i was like wtf I never did this with him
[2017/04/05, 19:06:04] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but he did do them yesterday I think
[2017/04/05, 19:06:20] Stuart Mesham: On slide 22/23
[2017/04/05, 19:06:23] Stuart Mesham: Around there
[2017/04/05, 19:08:10] Luc Hayward: yeah but he never did them where there was more than one substance
[2017/04/05, 19:08:21] Luc Hayward: we only did it with singular substances
[2017/04/05, 19:08:46] Stuart Mesham: But he did write the q = -q on the board
[2017/04/05, 19:08:57] Stuart Mesham: !!!
[2017/04/05, 19:08:58] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/04/05, 19:09:00] Luc Hayward: worked that out
[2017/04/05, 19:09:03] Luc Hayward: hoped it was right
[2017/04/05, 19:09:10] Luc Hayward: I'll check now
[2017/04/05, 19:09:22] Luc Hayward: do you have scissors and a protractor for me tomorrow?? for chem prac?
[2017/04/05, 19:09:39] Stuart Mesham: I got scissors
[2017/04/05, 19:09:47] Luc Hayward: no protractor?
[2017/04/05, 19:09:54] Stuart Mesham: No soz
[2017/04/05, 19:10:26] Luc Hayward: I had  3) 1.1kJ/mol
and 4) 5.94kJ/mol
[2017/04/05, 19:10:28] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/04/05, 19:10:33] Luc Hayward: bring scissors for me?
[2017/04/05, 19:11:27] Stuart Mesham: I didn't get the same answers at all 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/04/05, 19:11:36] Stuart Mesham: Sure 👍🏻
[2017/04/05, 19:12:12] Luc Hayward: lol ok
[2017/04/05, 19:13:13] Stuart Mesham: 3) 6.04x10 kJ/mol
4) 6.55x10^6 J/mol
[2017/04/05, 19:13:55] Luc Hayward: Send me your working?
[2017/04/05, 19:15:09] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/05, 19:52:54] Luc Hayward: Why the random adding of 273.15 degrees
[2017/04/05, 19:53:45] Luc Hayward: If you want it in Kelvin, fine but cover both to Kelvin?
[2017/04/05, 19:53:57] Luc Hayward: If you keep them in degrees then it also should work
[2017/04/05, 19:56:05] Stuart Mesham: That did convert them both to Kelvin
[2017/04/05, 19:56:19] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait
[2017/04/05, 19:56:30] Stuart Mesham: Silly me
[2017/04/05, 19:57:05] Stuart Mesham: Did you say 5725 kJ/mol for 5. b)?
[2017/04/05, 19:58:08] Luc Hayward: No you didn't....
[2017/04/05, 19:58:19] Luc Hayward: I dno it's packed now
[2017/04/06, 06:37:32] Luc Hayward: Will look today
[2017/04/06, 08:10:33] Luc Hayward: Choose Jameson hall at eleven
[2017/04/06, 09:58:13] Luc Hayward: Where you ?
[2017/04/06, 09:59:40] Luc Hayward: Come to bio Library
[2017/04/06, 10:32:05] Luc Hayward: Wait how did you do the chem tut without a protractor
[2017/04/06, 11:01:45] Stuart Mesham: Are you coming to comp sci?
[2017/04/06, 13:45:46] Luc Hayward: Ay
[2017/04/06, 13:46:06] Luc Hayward: You check the email from Maria keet? About the standard bank programming challenge?
[2017/04/06, 13:48:14] Luc Hayward: Could be interesting
[2017/04/06, 13:48:17] Luc Hayward: Team based
[2017/04/06, 13:48:19] Luc Hayward: One pc
[2017/04/06, 13:48:22] Luc Hayward: 4 hours
[2017/04/06, 13:50:39] Luc Hayward: Trans of three or four
[2017/04/06, 13:51:12] Luc Hayward: Teams*
[2017/04/06, 13:51:37] Luc Hayward: Must include one of each gender and one person from a disadvantaged background
[2017/04/06, 13:52:00] Luc Hayward: Theme is block chain
[2017/04/06, 13:52:02] Luc Hayward: There's prizes
[2017/04/06, 14:54:59] Stuart Mesham: Ooh sounds very interesting
[2017/04/06, 14:54:59] Stuart Mesham: You'll have to be the trans though if we go on the same team
[2017/04/06, 14:55:00] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna send Dawood an email saying the memos aren't on Vula now
[2017/04/06, 14:58:17] Luc Hayward: Just finished chem
[2017/04/06, 14:58:24] Luc Hayward: Easy to do in user and hour
[2017/04/06, 14:58:27] Luc Hayward: Under
[2017/04/06, 14:58:37] Luc Hayward: 😂👍🏻
[2017/04/06, 14:59:14] Luc Hayward: Yeah well read the email? Might be interesting for us to do together if we can find someone from a disadvantaged background
[2017/04/06, 14:59:39] Luc Hayward: Thing is I don't know anyone. And I can't think of any girls either. That are good enough that we won't be slowed down
[2017/04/06, 15:02:09] Luc Hayward: Else we just email Maria and say we're interested to do it together but we don't know anyone(cus first year) that would round out the team to make it fit the rules
[2017/04/06, 15:02:17] Luc Hayward: And see if she can help us
[2017/04/06, 15:04:12] Luc Hayward: Uct had won for 4 years in a row
[2017/04/06, 15:55:16] Stuart Mesham: Good idea
[2017/04/06, 16:07:20] Luc Hayward: You wanna do that?
[2017/04/06, 16:28:16] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/06, 16:28:58] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'll read the email later though
[2017/04/06, 16:30:17] Luc Hayward: Did you draw the triangle
[2017/04/06, 16:30:43] Stuart Mesham: Yes!
[2017/04/06, 16:30:44] Luc Hayward: Try writing it as root 8
[2017/04/06, 16:30:52] Stuart Mesham: I did that first!
[2017/04/06, 16:31:20] Stuart Mesham: This was my second attempt because I thought maybe they want it simplified but it's still wrong!
[2017/04/06, 16:31:33] Luc Hayward: I don't have a clue
[2017/04/06, 16:31:42] Luc Hayward: Ask shock? Like click ask the teacher
[2017/04/06, 16:33:15] Stuart Mesham: Do you think it shows him the answers I typed in here?
[2017/04/06, 16:33:26] Luc Hayward: No idea
[2017/04/06, 16:34:44] Stuart Mesham: There are no +- (together) symbols
[2017/04/06, 16:35:01] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/04/06, 16:35:22] Stuart Mesham: six could be + or -
[2017/04/06, 16:35:24] Stuart Mesham: *sinx
[2017/04/06, 16:35:32] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/04/06, 16:35:34] Luc Hayward: Never
[2017/04/06, 16:35:41] Stuart Mesham: I think that may be the issue
[2017/04/06, 16:36:00] Luc Hayward: It's in the third quadrant
[2017/04/06, 16:36:12] Stuart Mesham: Second or third
[2017/04/06, 16:36:22] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/04/06, 16:36:24] Stuart Mesham: Oh nevermind
[2017/04/06, 16:36:28] Stuart Mesham: Just the third
[2017/04/06, 16:36:43] Luc Hayward: Yeah just third
[2017/04/06, 16:36:48] Luc Hayward: Don't make me don't myself
[2017/04/06, 16:36:48] Stuart Mesham: So it's negative
[2017/04/06, 16:38:31] Stuart Mesham: Yay that was the problem
[2017/04/06, 16:38:50] Stuart Mesham: They were all meant to be only in the third quadrant
[2017/04/06, 16:38:56] Luc Hayward: Yeah..
[2017/04/06, 18:18:26] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/06, 18:19:54] Stuart Mesham: Jurie's gonna explain that to us tomorrow
[2017/04/06, 18:20:20] Luc Hayward: no....when did he say that??
[2017/04/06, 18:20:31] Stuart Mesham: End of today's lecture
[2017/04/06, 18:21:19] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/06, 18:21:27] Stuart Mesham: He said we'd learn the "quadratic equation" for trinomials etc. and showed us the picture of the guy who proved the formula doesn't exist for x^5 equations
[2017/04/06, 18:22:24] Stuart Mesham: Please put that into the Webassign 😂
[2017/04/06, 18:38:41] Luc Hayward: textbook doesnt have examples(only very very simple stuff ) and graphing it gives the wrong answer it seems
[2017/04/06, 18:42:52] Luc Hayward: Jesus Jono no wonder I was stuck
[2017/04/06, 18:43:13] Luc Hayward: It says f'(x)^-1
[2017/04/06, 18:43:22] Luc Hayward: That is to say the inverse derivative
[2017/04/06, 18:43:38] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/04/06, 18:43:40] Luc Hayward: Not even
[2017/04/06, 18:44:05] Luc Hayward: Yeah the inverse derivative
[2017/04/06, 19:41:38] Stuart Mesham: ?
[2017/04/06, 19:44:06] Stuart Mesham: Were these messages meant for me?
[2017/04/06, 19:51:38] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/06, 19:51:55] Luc Hayward: Jono is Johnathon Shock
[2017/04/07, 07:59:46] Stuart Mesham: Tell me if you find out what that was
[2017/04/07, 08:01:57] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/07, 10:47:35] Stuart Mesham: Shalt thou comp sci?
[2017/04/07, 10:47:48] Luc Hayward: Yea
[2017/04/07, 10:48:01] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/04/07, 11:01:12] Luc Hayward: No Lecture it seems
[2017/04/07, 11:49:20] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/04/07, 11:49:22] Stuart Mesham: Did you go to the bio library?
[2017/04/07, 12:00:54] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/04/07, 12:07:11] Luc Hayward: This guy next to me is chowing down on a whole cucumber
[2017/04/07, 13:23:29] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/04/07, 13:41:21] Luc Hayward: Tutor couldn't help
[2017/04/07, 13:41:29] Luc Hayward: Said I should email him the problem
[2017/04/07, 15:11:32] Stuart Mesham: Useless
[2017/04/09, 14:44:10] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/09, 14:45:44] Stuart Mesham: I could use that
[2017/04/09, 14:46:01] Stuart Mesham: Looks like Dawood called my bluff
[2017/04/09, 14:46:17] Stuart Mesham: I didn't even think about using the practicals to study 😂
[2017/04/09, 14:48:21] Stuart Mesham: Do you know if we actually have lectures tomorrow?
[2017/04/09, 14:50:59] Luc Hayward: We do
[2017/04/09, 14:51:16] Luc Hayward: Normal lectures Monday and Tuesday except no chemistry
[2017/04/09, 14:51:25] Luc Hayward: And no pracs or Tut's for our subjects this week
[2017/04/09, 14:51:33] Luc Hayward: What's that?
[2017/04/09, 14:54:00] Stuart Mesham: When I told him the prac memos would be really valuable for studying for the test
[2017/04/09, 15:01:54] Luc Hayward: Oh and what did he say?
[2017/04/09, 15:02:01] Luc Hayward: Didn't he Tel you no?
[2017/04/09, 15:03:35] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/04/09, 15:17:28] Luc Hayward: Ye
[2017/04/09, 15:17:50] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/09, 15:18:26] Stuart Mesham: Yes you knob
[2017/04/09, 15:18:55] Stuart Mesham: Remember when Jurie dropped a dirty on us?
[2017/04/09, 15:19:00] Stuart Mesham: That was it
[2017/04/09, 15:19:19] Luc Hayward: Yes did you follow it? Could you answer that one I sent you
[2017/04/09, 15:19:29] Stuart Mesham: I think so
[2017/04/09, 15:19:33] Stuart Mesham: Let me try
[2017/04/09, 15:25:45] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/04/09, 15:28:38] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/09, 15:28:43] Stuart Mesham: Where did you get this question?
[2017/04/09, 15:34:03] Luc Hayward: From Keegan
[2017/04/09, 15:34:24] Luc Hayward: Also yes that's right. 13sin(x+a)
[2017/04/09, 15:34:51] Stuart Mesham: And then the cos one is just 90-x-a
[2017/04/09, 15:36:54] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/09, 15:46:49] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/09, 15:47:10] Luc Hayward: What about it
[2017/04/09, 15:47:22] Stuart Mesham: This whole significant figure thing will forever remain a mystery to me
[2017/04/09, 15:48:07] Stuart Mesham: _Surely_ there should be 4 significant figures in all of them
[2017/04/09, 15:48:15] Luc Hayward: There should
[2017/04/09, 15:48:29] Luc Hayward: But the trailing 0s on the right are ambiguous
[2017/04/09, 15:48:50] Stuart Mesham: No that's only before the decimal point
[2017/04/09, 15:49:22] Luc Hayward: That's why I've now says that scientific notation is better in big numbers (10000 or 1x10^4) because it makes it clear hose many are significant
[2017/04/09, 15:49:21] Stuart Mesham: If they put 300.0 then it's _definitely_ 4
[2017/04/09, 15:49:50] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/04/09, 15:49:53] Stuart Mesham: This would be 3.000 x 10^2
[2017/04/09, 15:50:05] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/09, 15:50:24] Stuart Mesham: Voicenote's not downloading
[2017/04/09, 15:50:35] Stuart Mesham: I'll listen later when it comes through
[2017/04/09, 15:52:22] Luc Hayward: Just says he's being an idiot and that you're right
[2017/04/09, 15:53:03] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks 😂
[2017/04/09, 15:59:41] Luc Hayward: Are you studying chem over bio?
[2017/04/09, 16:06:01] Luc Hayward: Over maths
[2017/04/09, 16:25:06] Stuart Mesham: I'm hoping I can get through chem quickly
[2017/04/09, 16:25:30] Stuart Mesham: Because I think chem will be the easiest
[2017/04/09, 16:28:58] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/09, 16:29:37] Luc Hayward: Procrastination stu
[2017/04/09, 16:29:49] Luc Hayward: We have 6 hours to study chemistry on Wednesday alone
[2017/04/09, 16:30:05] Stuart Mesham: No lectures?
[2017/04/09, 16:30:17] Luc Hayward: There's no lectures on Wednesday or Thursday
[2017/04/09, 16:30:23] Luc Hayward: That's why we don't go in on Thursday
[2017/04/09, 16:30:24] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/04/09, 16:30:27] Stuart Mesham: That helps
[2017/04/09, 16:31:12] Luc Hayward: I'm seing 4 sf because of the 16.00 mas at the end
[2017/04/09, 16:31:15] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/09, 16:31:23] Luc Hayward: I'm not touching chem until Tuesday
[2017/04/09, 16:31:36] Luc Hayward: And I'm focusing on bio on Tuesday like 85%
[2017/04/09, 16:32:09] Luc Hayward: I feel like between the two of us we can manage to do chemistry in 5 hours
[2017/04/09, 16:32:30] Luc Hayward: We basically have the calculations down and it's not much new in theory
[2017/04/09, 16:32:30] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I thought there were lectures on Wednesday
[2017/04/09, 16:32:40] Luc Hayward: Nah Wednesday Thursday are free
[2017/04/09, 16:33:16] Stuart Mesham: I'm not confident that I'll be able to figure out these enigmatic significant figures though 😂😑
[2017/04/09, 16:33:51] Stuart Mesham: 5 hours to figure out their mysterious ways
[2017/04/09, 16:33:57] Stuart Mesham: It's gonna be tight
[2017/04/09, 16:34:18] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/04/09, 17:44:59] Stuart Mesham: The bio struggle is so real
[2017/04/09, 17:48:16] Luc Hayward: Nothing complex in that example though. 4 sf is right
[2017/04/09, 17:48:21] Luc Hayward: Bio struggle is real
[2017/04/09, 17:48:51] Stuart Mesham: Buzz question what are archaea?
[2017/04/09, 17:49:56] Stuart Mesham: But not because of the 6.022?
[2017/04/09, 17:50:54] Luc Hayward: Because of the 16.00
[2017/04/09, 17:50:59] Luc Hayward: Archae?
[2017/04/09, 17:51:08] Luc Hayward: The prokaryotes?
[2017/04/09, 17:51:08] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/04/09, 17:51:13] Stuart Mesham: 10 seconds
[2017/04/09, 17:51:20] Luc Hayward: Came before bacteria
[2017/04/09, 17:51:24] Luc Hayward: Single DNA ring
[2017/04/09, 17:51:26] Stuart Mesham: Aaaand
[2017/04/09, 17:51:29] Stuart Mesham: Aaaaaand
[2017/04/09, 17:51:32] Luc Hayward: Thought to be first form of life
[2017/04/09, 17:51:41] Stuart Mesham: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand
[2017/04/09, 17:51:53] Luc Hayward: Thought to be the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts
[2017/04/09, 17:51:55] Luc Hayward: Urm
[2017/04/09, 17:51:58] Luc Hayward: Single DNA loop
[2017/04/09, 17:52:02] Luc Hayward: Unicellular
[2017/04/09, 17:52:05] Stuart Mesham: Chemicals!
[2017/04/09, 17:52:10] Stuart Mesham: Chemosynthetic
[2017/04/09, 17:52:17] Luc Hayward: No! Not all of them are chemotrophs
[2017/04/09, 17:52:30] Luc Hayward: Some are phototrophic
[2017/04/09, 17:52:36] Stuart Mesham: Mike's powerpoint says so
[2017/04/09, 17:52:51] Luc Hayward: Really?
[2017/04/09, 17:53:12] Luc Hayward: But they gave rise to chloroplasts which photosynthesise
[2017/04/09, 17:53:15] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/09, 17:53:22] Luc Hayward: So some must have the ability to by phototrophic
[2017/04/09, 17:53:50] Stuart Mesham: I think they are all chemosynthetic though
[2017/04/09, 17:54:02] Luc Hayward: What does chemosynthetic mean?
[2017/04/09, 17:54:12] Luc Hayward: That the get their energy from chemicals?
[2017/04/09, 17:54:19] Stuart Mesham: They get their food from chemicals
[2017/04/09, 17:54:29] Stuart Mesham: So they could live in hydrothermal vents
[2017/04/09, 17:54:41] Stuart Mesham: Or in the chemical soup
[2017/04/09, 17:55:10] Luc Hayward: Not also from ingesting other archae?
[2017/04/09, 17:55:10] Stuart Mesham: The primitive soup
[2017/04/09, 17:55:24] Stuart Mesham: I don't think so
[2017/04/09, 17:55:30] Stuart Mesham: Not 100% sure
[2017/04/09, 17:56:37] Luc Hayward: Because they were able to ingest each other surely to make mitochondria
[2017/04/09, 17:57:24] Stuart Mesham: Hmm
[2017/04/09, 17:57:37] Stuart Mesham: I think the ability to ingest maybe came later
[2017/04/09, 17:57:55] Luc Hayward: But they're still archae
[2017/04/09, 17:58:06] Stuart Mesham: Because they lived for a while without mitochondria
[2017/04/09, 17:58:15] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/09, 17:58:30] Stuart Mesham: Good point
[2017/04/09, 17:58:31] Luc Hayward: But they're still archaea when the interest exact other
[2017/04/09, 17:58:48] Luc Hayward: And there are hundreds of species of arcgaea
[2017/04/09, 17:59:27] Stuart Mesham: Yeah so probably can ingest
[2017/04/09, 17:59:34] Stuart Mesham: At least some of the species
[2017/04/09, 18:01:17] Luc Hayward: Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both
[2017/04/09, 18:01:47] Luc Hayward: So they can create energy from organic compounds, inorganic compounds and light
[2017/04/09, 18:01:52] Luc Hayward: It would seem
[2017/04/09, 18:24:37] Stuart Mesham: Damn why is bio always so complicated 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/04/09, 18:56:59] Luc Hayward: Because it's a hoe
[2017/04/09, 18:57:07] Luc Hayward: I'm stopping for tonight to eat pizza
[2017/04/09, 18:57:25] Luc Hayward: Just taught myself parametric equations and then saw that we haven't covered then for he test .....
[2017/04/09, 18:59:14] Luc Hayward: So I'm feeling retarded
[2017/04/09, 19:42:50] Stuart Mesham: Same I just finished having pizza 🍕 😄
[2017/04/09, 19:43:16] Stuart Mesham: Dammit I did that yesterday! 😂🙈
[2017/04/09, 19:44:01] Luc Hayward: 😂😂😂
[2017/04/09, 19:44:13] Luc Hayward: But I totally understand them I think
[2017/04/09, 20:23:57] Stuart Mesham: High five ✋🏻
[2017/04/09, 20:24:10] Luc Hayward: High five😂
[2017/04/10, 06:49:04] Luc Hayward: Can you bring a jersey or a hoodie for me to maths?
[2017/04/10, 07:05:02] Stuart Mesham: Ok 😂
[2017/04/10, 07:05:42] Luc Hayward: It wasn't raining at home and the weather report said it was just cold not raining
[2017/04/10, 07:06:51] Stuart Mesham: I don't have a raincoat though
[2017/04/10, 07:07:00] Stuart Mesham: Only normal hoodies
[2017/04/10, 07:12:05] Luc Hayward: That's fine
[2017/04/10, 07:12:08] Luc Hayward: It'd freezing
[2017/04/10, 07:55:54] Luc Hayward: You going back to res today or staying to study with me?
[2017/04/10, 10:30:59] Luc Hayward: Special Properties
Adding:

The sum of two even functions is even
The sum of two odd functions is odd
The sum of an even and odd function is neither even nor odd (unless one function is zero).
Multiplying:

The product of two even functions is an even function.
The product of two odd functions is an even function.
The product of an even function and an odd function is an odd function.

[2017/04/10, 19:58:42] Stuart Mesham: No, soz 😂
[2017/04/10, 19:59:19] Stuart Mesham: I took my hoodie from the boot when I got my bag so don't stress looking for it 👍🏻
[2017/04/10, 20:22:10] Luc Hayward: 😱👌👌👌👌
[2017/04/11, 08:22:09] Luc Hayward: Library after this?
[2017/04/11, 08:29:36] Stuart Mesham: Chem today?
[2017/04/11, 08:29:52] Luc Hayward: Bio......... There's no chem lectures
[2017/04/11, 08:29:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/04/11, 08:30:08] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/11, 08:53:54] Luc Hayward: Same place as yesterday

[2017/04/11, 14:08:43] Luc Hayward: Not new
[2017/04/11, 14:08:50] Luc Hayward: Known about this for months
[2017/04/11, 14:08:51] Stuart Mesham: Just to undermine your studying
[2017/04/11, 15:32:58] Luc Hayward: You've undetermined

[2017/04/11, 15:38:01] Stuart Mesham: I'm​in the middle of a tea and rusks session so I'll watch those later
[2017/04/11, 15:38:10] Luc Hayward: watch them neeeeext
[2017/04/11, 15:38:21] Luc Hayward: they're in reverse order of interest
[2017/04/11, 15:38:55] Stuart Mesham: So the bottom is the best?
[2017/04/11, 15:39:31] Luc Hayward: yea
[2017/04/11, 15:40:33] Luc Hayward: the bottom one is awesome
[2017/04/11, 15:49:50] Stuart Mesham: Kk
[2017/04/11, 15:50:04] Luc Hayward: how fAR are you?
[2017/04/11, 15:50:26] Stuart Mesham: I'm just about to take a quick break from procrastination so I'll watch those afterwards
[2017/04/11, 15:50:38] Luc Hayward: nno i mean in bio
[2017/04/11, 15:50:53] Stuart Mesham: About to finish Mike's powerpoint
[2017/04/11, 15:55:13] Stuart Mesham: Yoh
[2017/04/11, 15:55:38] Stuart Mesham: But in the words of the researcher who cloned Dolly:
[2017/04/11, 15:55:48] Stuart Mesham: “cloning promises such great benefits that it would be immoral not to do it”
[2017/04/11, 15:56:14] Stuart Mesham: Bold
[2017/04/11, 15:56:57] Luc Hayward: I'm finishing terry's stuff now
[2017/04/11, 15:57:05] Luc Hayward: just got a bit more cell cycle to do
[2017/04/11, 16:04:43] Luc Hayward: been watching hank that science guy who talks super fast
[2017/04/11, 16:06:33] Stuart Mesham: Never heard of that
[2017/04/11, 16:06:46] Luc Hayward: you have

[2017/04/11, 16:35:09] Luc Hayward: hows it going
[2017/04/11, 16:35:21] Luc Hayward: I'm on Khan Academy
[2017/04/11, 16:35:44] Stuart Mesham: Going though lady's PowerPoints at speed 😅
[2017/04/11, 16:35:54] Luc Hayward: Khan academy mate
[2017/04/11, 16:35:59] Stuart Mesham: That's probably a good way to do it
[2017/04/11, 16:36:00] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/U5vAO_f2LDQ
[2017/04/11, 16:36:10] Stuart Mesham: Have you gone through all the PowerPoints?
[2017/04/11, 16:36:22] Luc Hayward: nah gna do that now
[2017/04/11, 16:37:15] Stuart Mesham: Yay cell cycle Kahn Academy hallelujah! 🙌🏻

[2017/04/11, 16:38:08] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/04/11, 17:42:35] Stuart Mesham: *Water reaches its greatest density at 4°C*
[2017/04/11, 17:42:37] Stuart Mesham: Remember that ^^
[2017/04/11, 17:42:52] Luc Hayward: Yeah. Very important for why we don't all die
[2017/04/11, 18:05:14] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/04/11, 18:05:15] Luc Hayward: Bam
[2017/04/11, 18:05:18] Luc Hayward: Fuck you bio
[2017/04/11, 18:05:28] Luc Hayward: I know you at least 70% I think
[2017/04/11, 18:15:54] Stuart Mesham: That was quick
[2017/04/11, 18:16:11] Stuart Mesham: Buzz question what are the 3 types of isomers? (that we know about)
[2017/04/11, 18:16:23] Luc Hayward: Nah gonna do another 45 minutes of isomers and organic chem
[2017/04/11, 18:16:27] Luc Hayward: Enantiomers
[2017/04/11, 18:16:33] Luc Hayward: Structural/geometric
[2017/04/11, 18:16:41] Luc Hayward: And that other one
[2017/04/11, 18:16:46] Luc Hayward: Cys trans
[2017/04/11, 18:16:50] Stuart Mesham: WRONG!
[2017/04/11, 18:17:04] Stuart Mesham: Structural isomers
Geometric isomers
Enantiomers
[2017/04/11, 18:17:09] Luc Hayward: Ok what are they
[2017/04/11, 18:17:18] Luc Hayward: What are cys trans then
[2017/04/11, 18:17:22] Stuart Mesham: Apparently the cis trans isn't a major type
[2017/04/11, 18:17:35] Stuart Mesham: They are geometric isomers
[2017/04/11, 18:17:41] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/04/11, 18:17:53] Luc Hayward: What's the difference between geometric and structural though
[2017/04/11, 18:18:49] Stuart Mesham: I think structural is branching and stuff whereas geometric are smaller differences like the orientation of individual atoms
[2017/04/11, 18:19:06] Stuart Mesham: Oh here we go
[2017/04/11, 18:19:09] Stuart Mesham: Structural isomers have different covalent arrangements of their atoms
[2017/04/11, 18:19:16] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/04/11, 18:19:16] Stuart Mesham: Geometric isomers have the same covalent arrangements but differ in spatial arrangements
[2017/04/11, 18:20:15] Luc Hayward: Structural = different covalent arrangements
Geometric = different spatial 
Enantiomers = ?
[2017/04/11, 18:20:46] Stuart Mesham: Structural = different covalent arrangements
Geometric = different spatial 
Enantiomers = mirror images of each other
[2017/04/11, 18:20:58] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/04/11, 18:21:09] Luc Hayward: And examples would be ....
[2017/04/11, 18:21:28] Stuart Mesham: I can do structural examples
[2017/04/11, 18:21:48] Luc Hayward: My PC just died and I not near my charge
[2017/04/11, 18:21:54] Stuart Mesham: Can't name any examples of the other ones
[2017/04/11, 18:22:03] Stuart Mesham: Aren't you at home?
[2017/04/11, 18:22:23] Luc Hayward: I am but I don't have my charger on me right now.
[2017/04/11, 18:23:46] Luc Hayward: Are you meeting me tomorrow in the morning ?
[2017/04/11, 18:24:26] Luc Hayward: You know that dr Marco asks definitions
[2017/04/11, 18:27:41] Stuart Mesham: Oh dear
[2017/04/11, 18:28:02] Stuart Mesham: Not to study
[2017/04/11, 18:28:14] Stuart Mesham: I'll be waking up as late as possible
[2017/04/11, 18:28:17] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/04/11, 18:28:24] Luc Hayward: I'm planning to study up in the morning
[2017/04/11, 18:28:37] Stuart Mesham: I don't like Dr Marco
[2017/04/11, 18:28:45] Luc Hayward: No not do I
[2017/04/11, 18:29:11] Stuart Mesham: Her powerpoints are also too long! 😂
[2017/04/11, 18:29:42] Luc Hayward: Right? Scroll all the way down to the end, make sure you can answer the slide at the end saying what she wanted you to be able to learn and be done
[2017/04/11, 18:38:51] Stuart Mesham: I'm still going through them for definitions etc.
[2017/04/11, 18:39:11] Luc Hayward: But she was quite clear that it's only those learning outcomes
[2017/04/11, 18:40:37] Stuart Mesham: True
[2017/04/11, 18:42:22] Stuart Mesham: Did you just Khanacademy the whole of hedderson's stuff?

[2017/04/11, 18:42:38] Luc Hayward: He all the new stuff
[2017/04/11, 18:42:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/04/11, 19:22:16] Stuart Mesham: So did you?
[2017/04/11, 19:53:21] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/12, 06:23:01] Luc Hayward: Looked at bio
[2017/04/12, 06:23:13] Luc Hayward: Number 1 is c
[2017/04/12, 06:23:29] Luc Hayward: 2 is right
[2017/04/12, 06:26:11] Luc Hayward: 3 is right
[2017/04/12, 06:35:39] Luc Hayward: 4 is right
[2017/04/12, 06:41:38] Luc Hayward: 5 is tough but I think it's right
[2017/04/12, 06:42:08] Luc Hayward: 6 is definitely right
[2017/04/12, 06:42:20] Luc Hayward: 7 is good
[2017/04/12, 06:42:35] Luc Hayward: 8 yes
[2017/04/12, 06:43:25] Luc Hayward: 8 yes
[2017/04/12, 06:43:30] Luc Hayward: 9 yes
[2017/04/12, 06:45:14] Luc Hayward: 10 is right but should be 10^23 surely?
[2017/04/12, 06:46:02] Luc Hayward: 15 yes
[2017/04/12, 06:46:18] Luc Hayward: 11-14 we did together
[2017/04/12, 06:47:51] Luc Hayward: 16 no. A chromatid is a replicate chromosome. In G1 there chromosomes are still spread out in the chromatin network
[2017/04/12, 06:49:31] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/12, 06:53:28] Luc Hayward: 18 you're right because the others are silly answers
[2017/04/12, 06:54:45] Luc Hayward: 19 no it's c. She should come them asexually
[2017/04/12, 06:55:20] Luc Hayward: 20 good

[2017/04/17, 21:24:39] Stuart Mesham: Oh thanks, didn't realise I'd be able to just google the answer 😂
[2017/04/17, 21:24:47] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/17, 21:25:19] Stuart Mesham: Thinking of that, you could probably have googled a diagram of a paramecium and just copied that in the other prac 😄
[2017/04/17, 21:25:29] Luc Hayward: No phones
[2017/04/17, 21:26:31] Stuart Mesham: Not? In the mixing/iodine testing one the person told me I could google what parts of a plant store starch
[2017/04/17, 21:26:51] Luc Hayward: Oh lol lab rules specifically say no phone
[2017/04/17, 21:27:16] Stuart Mesham: Oh maybe it's chilled
[2017/04/17, 21:27:50] Stuart Mesham: Maybe they're just like "oh it's first-years, whatever"
[2017/04/17, 21:28:02] Luc Hayward: Yeah like we aren't using any chemicals
[2017/04/17, 21:28:23] Stuart Mesham: Just the _terrifying_ paramecium
[2017/04/17, 21:32:18] Luc Hayward: Exactly
[2017/04/17, 21:45:15] Stuart Mesham: Do we do a flow diagram for the protractor prac?
[2017/04/17, 21:45:25] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/04/17, 21:45:43] Stuart Mesham: Great!
[2017/04/17, 21:45:44] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/04/18, 09:47:21] Luc Hayward: Where you
[2017/04/18, 09:47:44] Stuart Mesham: Outside
[2017/04/18, 09:47:48] Luc Hayward: Where
[2017/04/18, 09:47:52] Luc Hayward: I'm upstairs
[2017/04/18, 09:48:04] Stuart Mesham: Where
[2017/04/18, 09:48:14] Luc Hayward: By the lecture hall
[2017/04/18, 09:48:17] Stuart Mesham: I'm outside chem
[2017/04/18, 09:48:19] Luc Hayward: Like by the lecture
[2017/04/18, 09:48:22] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/04/18, 09:48:26] Luc Hayward: No I'm at physics
[2017/04/18, 09:48:30] Luc Hayward: I didn't see you at chem
[2017/04/18, 09:48:36] Stuart Mesham: Oh 😂
[2017/04/18, 09:48:43] Stuart Mesham: I'm coming
[2017/04/18, 09:48:52] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/04/18, 09:50:45] Luc Hayward: I'm waiting for you before I go in

[2017/04/21, 10:47:39] Stuart Mesham: I'm sure that's not allowed on the university network either
[2017/04/21, 17:44:34] Stuart Mesham: Your graph must've been wrong because I somehow got 97 on the maths decant test
[2017/04/21, 17:45:05] Stuart Mesham: I hope this one doesn't go down by itself like the chemistry one 😂
[2017/04/21, 17:45:52] Luc Hayward: Dno
[2017/04/21, 17:46:15] Stuart Mesham: I passed bio! 🎉
[2017/04/21, 17:46:56] Stuart Mesham: Passed 😅
[2017/04/21, 21:00:34] Luc Hayward: Yeah fuck these tests
[2017/04/21, 21:03:16] Luc Hayward: What did you get for bio
[2017/04/21, 23:30:20] Stuart Mesham: 62... Flying colours! 😀🙁

[2017/04/23, 17:26:17] Stuart Mesham: Do you happen to have an earphone/aux plug splitter?
[2017/04/23, 17:27:58] Luc Hayward: No👎🏻👎🏻
[2017/04/23, 17:31:39] Luc Hayward: That scene is so crap

[2017/04/23, 17:52:08] Luc Hayward: What utter crap😂😂
[2017/04/23, 17:57:58] Stuart Mesham: It's so great 👌🏻😄
[2017/04/24, 13:26:58] Stuart Mesham: Every single printer everywhere is down so I'm gonna have to write mine out in the library
[2017/04/24, 14:08:47] Luc Hayward: Fuck
[2017/04/24, 14:08:48] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/04/24, 14:09:13] Luc Hayward: Chat later about the challenge thing
[2017/04/24, 14:10:27] Luc Hayward: Fei(the Asian girl) seems fine. Poor syntactically but problem solving is fine. Gonna put us three together and send that to Maria?
[2017/04/24, 16:50:32] Stuart Mesham: Ok perfect 👍🏻
[2017/04/24, 16:50:39] Stuart Mesham: Is she first year?
[2017/04/24, 16:50:48] Luc Hayward: Second
[2017/04/24, 16:52:34] Stuart Mesham: Ah still good
[2017/04/24, 16:52:39] Stuart Mesham: Better probably
[2017/04/24, 16:53:06] Luc Hayward: Yeah she tried a few challenge problems last year
[2017/04/24, 16:53:35] Luc Hayward: I think here javas is better than her python but python is where I think we will stay for hacking stuff together quickly
[2017/04/24, 16:54:01] Luc Hayward: We get to have physical notes
[2017/04/24, 16:54:00] Stuart Mesham: Agreed
[2017/04/24, 16:54:14] Stuart Mesham: Yesss! 😄
[2017/04/24, 16:54:22] Luc Hayward: And can go in early to make sure we have whatever ide we want, setup to our standard
[2017/04/24, 16:54:37] Luc Hayward: But we must use the varsity conputers
[2017/04/24, 16:54:57] Luc Hayward: And they all run Ubuntu I think? Some brand of linux
[2017/04/24, 16:55:17] Stuart Mesham: Oh probably ubuntu
[2017/04/24, 16:55:29] Stuart Mesham: I Jurie uses Ubuntu 😄
[2017/04/24, 16:55:36] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/24, 16:55:34] Stuart Mesham: *I think
[2017/04/24, 16:55:57] Luc Hayward: Dno that the lab PC has python3 though so we would need that too
[2017/04/24, 16:56:03] Luc Hayward: And then yeah you or I type
[2017/04/24, 16:56:11] Stuart Mesham: They must have it
[2017/04/24, 16:56:36] Luc Hayward: I found it best to have one person writing code and then the others can write up pseudo for other problems
[2017/04/24, 16:57:22] Stuart Mesham: How about if one person has thought up a solution to a problem then they just type it while the others keep working on the others
[2017/04/24, 16:57:40] Stuart Mesham: *keep thinking about how to do the other questions
[2017/04/24, 16:58:35] Luc Hayward: That would also work but I think you or I must code
[2017/04/24, 16:58:58] Luc Hayward: Also it's a mission to get up and down swapping chairs unless we have space to just roll our chairs left and right
[2017/04/24, 16:59:26] Luc Hayward: Will chat on hangouts in like 15?

[2017/04/25, 13:04:36] Stuart Mesham: *at
[2017/04/25, 13:05:01] Luc Hayward: Ye
[2017/04/25, 13:05:14] Stuart Mesham: Gonna get my maths and then come
[2017/04/25, 13:06:17] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/04/25, 13:06:22] Luc Hayward: Line is ultra long
[2017/04/25, 13:06:28] Luc Hayward: And I'm leaving in like 10 min
[2017/04/25, 13:15:25] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/04/25, 13:15:32] Stuart Mesham: Oh well
[2017/04/25, 13:15:41] Stuart Mesham: I'm almost there
[2017/04/25, 13:16:49] Stuart Mesham: Which part of the architect building are you?
[2017/04/25, 13:17:03] Luc Hayward: First door
[2017/04/25, 13:17:05] Stuart Mesham: I just walked in from the south side door
[2017/04/25, 13:17:10] Luc Hayward: Like the left door
[2017/04/25, 13:17:14] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/04/25, 13:17:20] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/04/25, 19:58:57] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/04/25, 20:00:53] Luc Hayward: What is that
[2017/04/25, 20:01:11] Luc Hayward: And no it's not?
[2017/04/25, 20:01:18] Luc Hayward: If x is rational, square it
[2017/04/25, 20:01:24] Stuart Mesham: You have to work out what it is
[2017/04/25, 20:01:26] Luc Hayward: If it's irrational, stay the same
[2017/04/25, 20:01:29] Stuart Mesham: So it's 0?
[2017/04/25, 20:02:25] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/04/25, 20:02:44] Stuart Mesham: It seems too easy 😂
[2017/04/25, 20:02:50] Stuart Mesham: Must be a trap
[2017/04/25, 20:03:31] Luc Hayward: That's it

[2017/04/28, 12:15:46] Luc Hayward: What? What bio?
[2017/04/28, 12:15:50] Luc Hayward: There's no bio....
[2017/04/28, 12:15:55] Luc Hayward: We only had maths today...
[2017/04/28, 12:16:12] Stuart Mesham: Oh I thought we had bio 🙈
[2017/04/28, 12:16:20] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/04/28, 12:16:30] Stuart Mesham: I just walked up to the lecture back to my room 😂
[2017/04/28, 12:16:39] Stuart Mesham: Good exercise 👍🏻😃
[2017/04/30, 12:56:36] Luc Hayward: are you sure the challenge heats are on the 5th of may for comp sci thing
[2017/04/30, 14:07:06] Stuart Mesham: Sorry on the 6th
[2017/04/30, 14:15:34] Luc Hayward: That's a Saturday?
[2017/04/30, 14:40:46] Luc Hayward: Good lord kill me now

[2017/04/30, 15:06:22] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it is on Saturday
[2017/04/30, 15:07:01] Stuart Mesham: Could you be a lamb and look up the time for me please? (I'm in Hermanus so the signal is a struggle)
[2017/04/30, 15:07:23] Luc Hayward: I'll look at home
[2017/04/30, 15:07:31] Luc Hayward: I won't be able to make that though I'm in knysna
[2017/04/30, 15:11:48] Stuart Mesham: I just found out that I have a family lunch thing for a cousin's graduation which might clash with the competition
[2017/04/30, 15:13:57] Stuart Mesham: To be honest though I don't really want to do the competition _on a Saturday_ and _during vac_ and without you 🙈
[2017/04/30, 15:14:46] Stuart Mesham: I'm sure Fei is great but the competition is just at a bad time 😄
[2017/04/30, 15:15:28] Stuart Mesham: I think we should bail
[2017/04/30, 15:15:29] Stuart Mesham: Sorry Fei
[2017/04/30, 15:15:56] Stuart Mesham: But if we bail now there would be time for her to find other teammates
[2017/04/30, 15:47:52] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/04/30, 15:48:04] Luc Hayward: I'll message her If you'll email Maria
[2017/04/30, 15:56:14] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'll email Maria now and say we're both in Knysna and we've told Fei and hope that she'll be able to find another group
[2017/04/30, 16:41:14] Luc Hayward: Works for me
[2017/05/01, 08:58:08] Luc Hayward: Yo
[2017/05/01, 09:14:07] Luc Hayward: When you did your skippers in December had you already been driving for long enough right?
[2017/05/01, 15:03:01] Stuart Mesham: Not _thaat_ long
[2017/05/01, 15:03:14] Luc Hayward: 😂👌
[2017/05/01, 15:03:24] Stuart Mesham: You just have to be able to dock (sort of) 😄
[2017/05/01, 15:03:42] Stuart Mesham: As in drive up next to the jetty
[2017/05/01, 15:03:45] Luc Hayward: 😂 ah yeah.
[2017/05/01, 15:04:32] Luc Hayward: In theory in able to do that😂
[2017/05/01, 15:05:16] Stuart Mesham: I think I messed it up the first time, he's quite chilled about it 😂
[2017/05/01, 15:05:24] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/05/01, 15:06:11] Stuart Mesham: Even some people that messed it up like 4 times he still gave them the temporary license and said they needed to practice before they drove someone else's boat 😂
[2017/05/01, 15:06:56] Luc Hayward: 😂😂 wow that's so relaxed about it all. Kinda scary to think there can be such bad people on the water😂
[2017/05/01, 15:08:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but it's true that people do generally take caution for fear of their own life 😄
[2017/05/01, 15:09:08] Stuart Mesham: Even though car driving doesn't seem to have that effect
[2017/05/01, 15:09:14] Stuart Mesham: I guess the sea is scarier
[2017/05/01, 15:09:23] Luc Hayward: It's not looking like my dad's boat will be out of the shop this week which is bleak.
[2017/05/01, 15:09:36] Stuart Mesham: Ah no
[2017/05/01, 15:09:48] Luc Hayward: So I dno that oil bother to try for my license this week 👎🏻
[2017/05/01, 15:09:54] Luc Hayward: I'll bother**
[2017/05/01, 15:10:15] Stuart Mesham: If you've already started then you may as well finish
[2017/05/01, 15:11:55] Luc Hayward: Seems like an effort to claim I've done my 30 hours behind the wheel, do all the theory stuff and  then try to do the practical side when I've really not driven much
[2017/05/01, 15:12:53] Luc Hayward: Nah I haven't started with anything other than driving a bit in breeder with friends and then driving sometimes with the Kane's
[2017/05/01, 15:13:11] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I guess you may as well not be one of the "you need to practice before you drive a boat" people 😄
[2017/05/01, 15:13:21] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/01, 15:13:30] Luc Hayward: Rather get some more driving in
[2017/05/01, 15:13:51] Luc Hayward: Check with you and Make sure I can do all the stuff that they check
[2017/05/01, 15:14:04] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/01, 15:18:11] Luc Hayward: And then do it like in June holidays or after tests or something.
[2017/05/01, 15:19:10] Luc Hayward: There's not really likely to be much chance to go out on the water with the Kane's now that winter has set in

[2017/05/01, 20:54:59] Luc Hayward: My signal is ass too
[2017/05/01, 21:42:46] Stuart Mesham: Sure 👍🏻
[2017/05/01, 21:49:50] Luc Hayward: Have you looked at the challenge problemz
[2017/05/01, 21:52:01] Stuart Mesham: Nooo, will probably only do that after I go home
[2017/05/01, 21:52:32] Luc Hayward: Ok ill try to finish them early so I can give you advice
[2017/05/01, 21:52:50] Luc Hayward: Actually really quite interesting this time
[2017/05/01, 21:56:00] Luc Hayward: 1) given a number of groups and the average period between each groups protests, predict the number of affected work days in a given time period.
[2017/05/01, 21:56:39] Stuart Mesham: That's brave 😂
[2017/05/01, 21:57:17] Luc Hayward: 2) given a string at most 1 million characters long of either 1 or 0, determine whether every character between two indices is the same.
[2017/05/01, 21:57:35] Luc Hayward: And three is actually like a real problem
[2017/05/01, 21:58:29] Stuart Mesham: How do you do this without checking each character??
[2017/05/01, 22:00:00] Luc Hayward: It's a variation on bin sorting problems. Given a set of three bins each containing some number of green clear or brown bottles, determine the minimum number of moves required so that each bin contains only one type of bottle. 

In the case of multiple possible results give the result in best alphabetical order. 

There will be a maximun of 2^31 bottles in total
[2017/05/01, 22:00:18] Luc Hayward: But It is actually a fantastic real world problem
[2017/05/01, 22:02:00] Luc Hayward: And has real consequences in the world. Because bin sorting is essentially NP-complete. Ie it cannot be solved in polynomial(fast) time. As the number of cases increases, time taken to complete grows exponentially or factorially(not polynomial). 

It can only be checked to test a solution.
[2017/05/01, 22:02:36] Luc Hayward: Honestly looks like the best way is to iterate over it.
[2017/05/01, 22:02:58] Luc Hayward: For 2) I'll just try with a string.contains() or the python equivalent
[2017/05/01, 22:04:06] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'd just see what the first character is and then keep iterating until you find a different character or get to the end
[2017/05/01, 22:04:19] Luc Hayward: Yeah so that's first try for that one
[2017/05/01, 22:04:21] Stuart Mesham: But the bin one sounds outrageously hard 😂
[2017/05/01, 22:04:34] Luc Hayward: Looking at it it's actually grossly simplified
[2017/05/01, 22:04:50] Stuart Mesham: What are the rules?
[2017/05/01, 22:04:59] Luc Hayward: I don't think it will prove massively challenging in its current form particularly because it is constrained to three groups of three
[2017/05/01, 22:05:03] Stuart Mesham: Can you only move the bottle at the top each time?
[2017/05/01, 22:05:12] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/05/01, 22:05:30] Luc Hayward: Basically you treat it as though every bottle is moveable at all times
[2017/05/01, 22:05:55] Luc Hayward: Not even a fancy tower of Hanoi problem.
[2017/05/01, 22:06:00] Stuart Mesham: Oh but then it's too easy surely?
[2017/05/01, 22:06:07] Luc Hayward: Send that way
[2017/05/01, 22:06:10] Luc Hayward: Seems
[2017/05/01, 22:06:17] Stuart Mesham: You just see which bin currently has the most of each bottle
[2017/05/01, 22:06:25] Luc Hayward: Exactly
[2017/05/01, 22:06:37] Luc Hayward: Just a very basic first fit store algorithm
[2017/05/01, 22:06:42] Luc Hayward: Style not store
[2017/05/01, 22:06:45] Stuart Mesham: Oh I thought it was a tower of Hanoi type thing
[2017/05/01, 22:07:01] Luc Hayward: Yeah so I'll try that tomorrow morning
[2017/05/01, 22:07:42] Stuart Mesham: I'll be home either tomorrow evening or Wednesday so I'll give them a try then
[2017/05/01, 22:08:25] Luc Hayward: But bin sorting as a problem is really complex. And currently on a large scale side is only doable(not solvable) using heuristics and/or algorithms that approximate a best case solution to within a (hopefully high) accuracy
[2017/05/01, 22:09:40] Stuart Mesham: Is that with lots of bins and lots of types of bottles?
[2017/05/01, 22:10:01] Luc Hayward: So the problem we have is a simple variation on bin sorting
[2017/05/01, 22:10:32] Stuart Mesham: Oh I wonder what bin sorting is used for 😄
[2017/05/01, 22:11:58] Luc Hayward: In the real world, you look at it like a travelling salesman problem( basically finding the shortest distance to reach every node). So say you have a whole load of things to deliver to the shops. Each thing has a different weight. Your truck can handle x weight per trip. You have infinite trucks. What is the most efficient way to pack your items to minimise the number of trips required
[2017/05/01, 22:12:43] Luc Hayward: Now you could test every possible combination if you had say 100 items. But what happens when you need to move 10000 items a day.
[2017/05/01, 22:13:13] Luc Hayward: That's where you need to approximate a mostly efficient way in a relatively short amount of time.
[2017/05/01, 22:14:20] Luc Hayward: There's quite a bit of reading into something called dynamic programming which I didn't properly follow but the idea is that you use the data gathered by solving previous problems(say with 100 items) to solve larger problems(say 150 items) faster
[2017/05/01, 22:16:39] Luc Hayward: Can also branch out into implications for pushing texturemaps for game development so that you reduce storage space by fitting textures into as small an area as possible (reduce whitespace)
[2017/05/01, 22:18:42] Stuart Mesham: Wow you've done quite a bit of reading on this
[2017/05/01, 22:18:53] Luc Hayward: I got bored today in the car
[2017/05/01, 22:19:03] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/05/01, 22:20:04] Stuart Mesham: The Message.parse() in my brain is giving a whole lot of red lines
[2017/05/01, 22:20:10] Stuart Mesham: It just exploded
[2017/05/01, 22:20:24] Luc Hayward: What?  😂😂
[2017/05/01, 22:20:56] Stuart Mesham: AP comprehension skills needed here
[2017/05/01, 22:21:08] Luc Hayward: Did I fuck up my spelling
[2017/05/01, 22:21:32] Stuart Mesham: We got from this
[2017/05/01, 22:21:39] Stuart Mesham: To this
[2017/05/01, 22:22:00] Luc Hayward: 😂😂 sorry sorry can explain in hangouts in the week
[2017/05/01, 22:22:24] Luc Hayward: Also we need to work out version control
[2017/05/01, 22:22:27] Luc Hayward: (git)
[2017/05/01, 22:22:39] Luc Hayward: I did some more reading and think I've figured out a workflow
[2017/05/01, 22:22:49] Stuart Mesham: Isn't this a completely different problem to the bin sorting one though?
[2017/05/01, 22:23:09] Stuart Mesham: Yes! We must do this!
[2017/05/01, 22:24:13] Luc Hayward: They seem to be derived from the same idea that you have a grip of values or weights and you need to find the most efficient way to use all those values.
[2017/05/01, 22:25:25] Stuart Mesham: We'll have to hangouts in the week
[2017/05/01, 22:26:06] Stuart Mesham: This is too much logic and reasoning for late night conversation 😂
[2017/05/01, 22:26:18] Luc Hayward: Deal
[2017/05/01, 22:26:31] Stuart Mesham: Do you have WiFi in Knysna?
[2017/05/01, 22:26:43] Luc Hayward: Yeah was just being weird today
[2017/05/01, 22:27:31] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool we'll be good for hangouts when I get home then 👌🏻
[2017/05/02, 10:14:05] Stuart Mesham: Oh dear
[2017/05/02, 10:14:40] Stuart Mesham: Maria said "this is quite improper behaviour" 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/05/02, 10:15:01] Luc Hayward: Maria can sucj a dicj
[2017/05/02, 10:15:16] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/05/02, 10:15:23] Luc Hayward: Not our fault we didn't know we would be busy
[2017/05/02, 10:15:41] Stuart Mesham: At least we gave them time to sort it out
[2017/05/02, 10:15:54] Luc Hayward: If she moans hard tell her fei wouldn't have made it through anyhow. It's not like we pulled out of a winning team
[2017/05/02, 10:16:24] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I mean we are the n00bz after all
[2017/05/02, 10:16:37] Stuart Mesham: We were probably the only first years
[2017/05/02, 10:17:03] Luc Hayward: Yeah exactly
[2017/05/02, 10:44:53] Luc Hayward: Let her take a chill pill
[2017/05/02, 17:17:05] Luc Hayward: Check r/Unity3D for a post (with the paper) on an attempt to use neural nets to automate animations (provide a whole load of motion capture data)
[2017/05/02, 18:01:23] Stuart Mesham: You forgot the link
[2017/05/02, 18:13:40] Luc Hayward: Figured you could search it up
[2017/05/02, 19:40:33] Stuart Mesham: Oh you typed that! I thought you clicked share and then somehow deleted the link and left the description thing 🙈😂
[2017/05/02, 19:49:40] Luc Hayward: 😂😂😂😂
[2017/05/02, 20:43:55] Stuart Mesham: I can't find it
[2017/05/02, 20:44:34] Luc Hayward: I'll send it

[2017/05/03, 14:28:49] Luc Hayward: That’s chilled. Specifically take a look at problems I think their answer is wrong
[2017/05/03, 14:42:28] Luc Hayward: Fuck this I know my stuff works at least for the sample inputs. The first test case is always the sample input right ?
[2017/05/03, 19:29:07] Luc Hayward: How good was silicon valley
[2017/05/04, 13:31:54] Luc Hayward: yo

[2017/05/04, 18:31:49] Stuart Mesham: As long as I'm not having supper by then 😂
[2017/05/04, 18:32:03] Luc Hayward: Else after you eat?
[2017/05/04, 18:38:29] Luc Hayward: oi focker
[2017/05/04, 18:38:35] Luc Hayward: ye talkin to me focker?
[2017/05/04, 18:32:29] Stuart Mesham: Yeah otherwise I can definitely call after I eat because I'm doing anything tonight
[2017/05/04, 18:56:33] Stuart Mesham: No! Starting supper right now! 🙈
[2017/05/04, 18:56:41] Stuart Mesham: Tell you when I'm done
[2017/05/04, 18:56:48] Luc Hayward: Cool

[2017/05/09, 13:28:05] Stuart Mesham: Where you?
[2017/05/09, 13:28:35] Luc Hayward: In the library
[2017/05/09, 13:28:54] Stuart Mesham: Ok nvm
[2017/05/09, 13:29:01] Luc Hayward: Why?
[2017/05/09, 13:29:13] Stuart Mesham: There was no lunch at Kopano re strike so I'm back here for lunch
[2017/05/09, 13:30:18] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/05/09, 13:30:24] Luc Hayward: ^^
[2017/05/09, 13:30:41] Stuart Mesham: I had to see Dawood
[2017/05/09, 13:30:56] Stuart Mesham: He replied that afternoon I think
[2017/05/09, 13:32:59] Luc Hayward: Why Dawood and not Hussein?
[2017/05/09, 13:33:20] Stuart Mesham: *Hussein 🙈
[2017/05/09, 13:35:15] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/05/09, 13:35:22] Luc Hayward: I'll give him another day then
[2017/05/09, 15:20:15] Luc Hayward: Hey man
[2017/05/09, 15:20:26] Luc Hayward: Are you coming to Keegan's on Friday and will you drink
[2017/05/09, 15:20:30] Luc Hayward: A lot
[2017/05/09, 15:38:42] Stuart Mesham: I still need to find out whether I can make it on Friday but if I do I won't drink a lot
[2017/05/09, 15:38:51] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/05/09, 15:39:33] Stuart Mesham: Would not drinking a lot be a deal breaker? 😂
[2017/05/09, 15:41:28] Stuart Mesham: Also, sign up for the 6pm Jammy comp sci test
[2017/05/09, 15:41:53] Luc Hayward: No sign up for Leslie social

[2017/05/09, 17:27:09] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/09, 21:58:21] Stuart Mesham: How long did the comp sci prac test take you?

[2017/05/09, 22:54:04] Luc Hayward: You know you can pitch to any of them and just add your name?
[2017/05/09, 22:54:34] Stuart Mesham: I joined one that looks like it might be really empty
[2017/05/09, 22:54:37] Stuart Mesham: 20 free spaces
[2017/05/09, 22:55:08] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but then I have to add my name as I walk out (mission) 😄
[2017/05/09, 23:03:02] Luc Hayward: You have to sign your name anyway
[2017/05/09, 23:03:39] Luc Hayward: Also when you know anything about Friday plans, just speak up on the group so Keegan knows ye?
[2017/05/09, 23:03:54] Stuart Mesham: But writing you student number etc ☝🏻
[2017/05/09, 23:03:59] Stuart Mesham: Yeah

[2017/05/10, 15:49:51] Stuart Mesham: Coffee place?
[2017/05/10, 15:53:03] Luc Hayward: Coffee
[2017/05/10, 15:53:04] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/10, 17:22:42] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/ewGAmiLuYCw?t=2m9s
[2017/05/10, 20:43:08] Luc Hayward: Stu
[2017/05/10, 21:01:10] Stuart Mesham: Sup
[2017/05/10, 21:02:31] Stuart Mesham: Ok it's a yes for Keegan's party
[2017/05/10, 21:04:24] Stuart Mesham: I think on Friday I'll get a lift home with Dan (so all my stuff can come home) and then you pick me up from my house?
[2017/05/10, 21:04:39] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/10, 21:05:00] Luc Hayward: Ignore that
[2017/05/10, 21:05:08] Luc Hayward: Couldnt put down
[2017/05/10, 21:05:16] Stuart Mesham: Mine said disconnected
[2017/05/10, 21:05:25] Luc Hayward: Just post on the group or to Keegan
[2017/05/10, 21:05:32] Luc Hayward: Yeah I can do that
[2017/05/10, 21:05:43] Luc Hayward: You'll have to uber home though I think
[2017/05/10, 21:05:46] Stuart Mesham: Oh the answers for the prac test, awesome
[2017/05/10, 21:05:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I will
[2017/05/10, 21:05:56] Luc Hayward: Probably ending around 10
[2017/05/10, 21:06:02] Luc Hayward: No😂😂
[2017/05/10, 21:06:18] Luc Hayward: Thats Keegan's attempt to answer my prac test
[2017/05/10, 21:06:26] Luc Hayward: Like it's not technically wrong
[2017/05/10, 21:06:28] Stuart Mesham: Oh 😂
[2017/05/10, 21:06:32] Luc Hayward: But read it
[2017/05/10, 21:07:03] Luc Hayward: I think I need to show him my way tomorrow
[2017/05/10, 21:08:11] Stuart Mesham: Woah it's so complicated 😄
[2017/05/10, 21:08:48] Luc Hayward: Right?
[2017/05/10, 21:09:08] Luc Hayward: None of them are TAUGHT to program in a way that is logical to read
[2017/05/10, 21:09:34] Stuart Mesham: Gap in this tertiary education 😂
[2017/05/10, 21:10:09] Luc Hayward: Absolutely. And consider he had already done one of those online courses which are actually super great to kick-start a language
[2017/05/10, 23:45:45] Stuart Mesham: But he's never coded (in any language) before so it makes sense that he's not used to writing code so it's not going to be the cleanest code ever
[2017/05/11, 01:58:46] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/11, 06:15:00] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/11, 06:15:44] Luc Hayward: So that one, the giant ass energy spike is caused by trying to remove an electron from a noble gas configuration
[2017/05/11, 07:58:23] Luc Hayward: The guy in front with the anime porn still has one of the og iPhone that had a 30 pin charger

[2017/05/11, 09:00:29] Stuart Mesham: Our Chem tests are here
[2017/05/11, 13:29:57] Luc Hayward: I got lost
[2017/05/11, 13:31:32] Stuart Mesham: How did you get lost?
[2017/05/11, 13:32:09] Luc Hayward: Well I found where I am meant to be now. Worked out that I had to wait at the reception(317) for the receptionist and apparently hussein is out still
[2017/05/11, 13:33:31] Stuart Mesham: Yeah just send him an email to make a time
[2017/05/11, 13:33:46] Luc Hayward: I already did, he’s 3 min late
[2017/05/11, 13:36:06] Luc Hayward: If he doesn't arrive by 1:50 I'm going to my chemistry prac and rescheduling
[2017/05/11, 13:36:36] Stuart Mesham: Didn't be late for the Chem prac
[2017/05/11, 13:37:02] Stuart Mesham: They'll lecture you on the importance of punctuality
[2017/05/11, 13:37:08] Luc Hayward: Yeah no I wont
[2017/05/11, 16:32:50] Luc Hayward: Ay so guess how many people they typically accept into the research course each year?
[2017/05/11, 16:52:15] Stuart Mesham: 2?
[2017/05/11, 16:53:26] Luc Hayward: Nah 10 but still
[2017/05/11, 17:15:21] Luc Hayward: So I can't lift you on Friday now.....
[2017/05/11, 17:15:29] Luc Hayward: Cus holly has pulled out
[2017/05/11, 17:15:37] Luc Hayward: So I'm going straight home from varsity
[2017/05/11, 17:50:29] Stuart Mesham: Nooooo
[2017/05/11, 17:50:40] Luc Hayward: ??
[2017/05/11, 17:50:41] Stuart Mesham: Are you still going?
[2017/05/11, 17:50:43] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/05/11, 17:51:23] Luc Hayward: If it's a problem I can stay/we can go back to your place
[2017/05/11, 17:51:45] Stuart Mesham: Isn't my house one route from St James?
[2017/05/11, 17:51:47] Stuart Mesham: *on
[2017/05/11, 17:51:56] Luc Hayward: not even close
[2017/05/11, 17:51:59] Luc Hayward: stu
[2017/05/11, 17:52:05] Luc Hayward: he lives in noordhoek
[2017/05/11, 17:52:39] Stuart Mesham: Oh damn the opposite way
[2017/05/11, 17:52:45] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/05/11, 17:52:53] Luc Hayward: but your house is on the way from varsity
[2017/05/11, 17:53:18] Stuart Mesham: Nah don't stay late just to lift
[2017/05/11, 17:53:36] Luc Hayward: but you have nothing on a friday
[2017/05/11, 17:53:59] Luc Hayward: why dont we just go back to yours, shower and change, finish whatever work we need to finish and then crash at chris till we leave
[2017/05/11, 17:53:59] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/11, 17:54:22] Stuart Mesham: That's a plan 😂
[2017/05/11, 17:54:29] Luc Hayward: cus like
[2017/05/11, 17:54:31] Luc Hayward: friday
[2017/05/11, 17:54:42] Stuart Mesham: But I need to check the Uber fare from Noordhoek to Constantia
[2017/05/11, 17:55:28] Stuart Mesham: Ok looks like it's about R200
[2017/05/11, 17:55:38] Stuart Mesham: That's fine
[2017/05/11, 17:56:16] Luc Hayward: like 165
[2017/05/11, 17:56:37] Luc Hayward: can lift you to steenberg and make it 100
[2017/05/11, 17:57:01] Stuart Mesham: That would help
[2017/05/11, 18:28:29] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/05/11, 19:04:22] Stuart Mesham: Are you having an afterparty in Steenberg?
[2017/05/11, 19:28:57] Luc Hayward: No I'm going home when they go to town
[2017/05/11, 19:29:16] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok
[2017/05/11, 19:29:24] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/11, 19:29:36] Luc Hayward: So I go that direction to go home and then we get you an uber from there
[2017/05/11, 19:30:19] Stuart Mesham: Cool
[2017/05/12, 13:15:44] Stuart Mesham: Ok Dan's going home at around 5:45 so we should be fine 👍🏻
[2017/05/12, 13:34:08] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/05/12, 17:48:53] Luc Hayward: 15 min
[2017/05/12, 17:49:16] Stuart Mesham: Go away I'm drinking tea
[2017/05/12, 17:49:37] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/05/12, 17:50:07] Stuart Mesham: Ok that's fine 😂
[2017/05/12, 17:58:42] Stuart Mesham: There's a good chance I'll be in the shower when you get here so Dan will let you in
[2017/05/12, 18:04:31] Luc Hayward: Here
[2017/05/14, 10:45:09] Stuart Mesham: Do you have a shit ton of work next weekend that I don't have?
[2017/05/14, 11:48:36] Luc Hayward: Same work
[2017/05/14, 11:48:44] Luc Hayward: I have extra maths this to do though
[2017/05/14, 11:49:40] Luc Hayward: Tuts
[2017/05/14, 13:21:36] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/14, 13:21:42] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/14, 13:21:49] Luc Hayward: that's their assignment
[2017/05/14, 13:50:56] Stuart Mesham: Woah that's cool 😄
[2017/05/14, 13:51:16] Luc Hayward: said I'd do it for gabi so if you feel like doing it for me for gabi.....
[2017/05/14, 13:51:36] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/14, 13:52:15] Stuart Mesham: I can't read that 😂
[2017/05/14, 13:52:46] Stuart Mesham: WhatsApp compresses photos to a maximum size
[2017/05/14, 13:52:47] Luc Hayward: oh shit
[2017/05/14, 13:53:10] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/05/14, 13:53:32] Luc Hayward: Find the derivative of the function using the definition of derivative.
f(x) = (7 + x)/(1 − 7x)
[2017/05/14, 13:53:23] Stuart Mesham: Is that Gilfoyle?
[2017/05/14, 13:53:46] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/05/14, 13:54:17] Stuart Mesham: The didn't ask me anything like that 😂
[2017/05/14, 13:54:51] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/05/14, 13:54:52] Stuart Mesham: The h should cancel out
[2017/05/14, 13:55:18] Stuart Mesham: If it doesn't then check your previous lines of working
[2017/05/14, 13:55:39] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/14, 13:55:46] Luc Hayward: no i know
[2017/05/14, 13:55:51] Luc Hayward: but its a mission
[2017/05/14, 13:56:01] Luc Hayward: ^^
[2017/05/14, 13:56:09] Stuart Mesham: I can't see a thing 😂
[2017/05/14, 13:56:21] Luc Hayward: can you not?
[2017/05/14, 13:56:27] Stuart Mesham: Hold on I'm being called for lunch
[2017/05/14, 13:56:32] Luc Hayward: kk
[2017/05/14, 13:56:53] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/14, 13:58:11] Luc Hayward: I can see that perfectly
[2017/05/14, 14:25:12] Stuart Mesham: Oh that's weird, now I can see it too
[2017/05/14, 14:25:27] Stuart Mesham: I'll take a look just now, still finishing lunch
[2017/05/14, 14:26:22] Luc Hayward: i made it work was being dumb
[2017/05/14, 14:26:36] Luc Hayward: but yeah if you feel like doing gabis stuff for her then i dont need to
[2017/05/14, 14:26:42] Luc Hayward: said i would do it today
[2017/05/14, 14:39:24] Stuart Mesham: How are you feeling for the comp sci test?
[2017/05/14, 14:41:39] Stuart Mesham: It's interesting to think about but actually doing it and plotting a graph is a mish so naah 😄
[2017/05/14, 14:44:05] Luc Hayward: you dont have to do the graph
[2017/05/14, 14:44:10] Luc Hayward: just said i would write the program
[2017/05/14, 14:44:31] Stuart Mesham: Hmm
[2017/05/14, 14:44:34] Stuart Mesham: Maybe later
[2017/05/14, 14:44:47] Stuart Mesham: ^^
[2017/05/14, 14:45:03] Luc Hayward: ok wel;l i said id do it today so if you are going to and are happy to finish it to help her, great. But if not I'll do it?:)_
[2017/05/14, 14:45:09] Luc Hayward: pretty chilled
[2017/05/14, 14:45:50] Luc Hayward: 3C
[2017/05/14, 14:45:45] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/14, 14:45:45] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/14, 14:45:55] Luc Hayward: Shes smoking her socks
[2017/05/14, 14:46:21] Luc Hayward: we have ages on monday to study
[2017/05/14, 14:46:28] Stuart Mesham: In the 2016 and 2015 there were a lot of questions where I saw the answer and I was like "That's really simple but I don't think I would've written that in the test"
[2017/05/14, 14:47:08] Luc Hayward: make  note of those please
[2017/05/14, 14:49:11] Stuart Mesham: I say it doesn't
[2017/05/14, 14:49:29] Luc Hayward: why
[2017/05/14, 14:49:31] Luc Hayward: i say it does
[2017/05/14, 14:49:32] Stuart Mesham: Too late 🙈
[2017/05/14, 14:49:50] Luc Hayward: hangouts?
[2017/05/14, 14:50:01] Stuart Mesham: You never execute the else
[2017/05/14, 14:50:09] Luc Hayward: you do
[2017/05/14, 14:50:11] Stuart Mesham: Not right now
[2017/05/14, 14:50:24] Stuart Mesham: I'm about to have some tea 😄
[2017/05/14, 14:50:50] Luc Hayward: second element in the loop is 3, which is more than t=2, therefore you run the else
[2017/05/14, 14:50:38] Stuart Mesham: No because it's <= not <
[2017/05/14, 14:51:10] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/05/14, 14:51:17] Luc Hayward: 3>2
[2017/05/14, 14:51:38] Stuart Mesham: The program replaces anything in the list (first parameter) that's less than or equal to the second parameter with the third parameter
[2017/05/14, 14:51:57] Stuart Mesham: Yeah so the else part isn't executed
[2017/05/14, 14:52:14] Stuart Mesham: And 2 >= 2 so the else part isn't executed there either
[2017/05/14, 14:53:29] Luc Hayward: nop.
[2017/05/14, 14:53:34] Luc Hayward: it makes a new list y
[2017/05/14, 14:54:30] Luc Hayward: no that would mean it is executed because if el(3) <= t(2) is false
[2017/05/14, 14:53:54] Stuart Mesham: y is the output of this
[2017/05/14, 14:55:53] Stuart Mesham: oh right it's that way around
[2017/05/14, 14:56:05] Stuart Mesham: then I say it does
[2017/05/14, 14:56:07] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/05/14, 14:56:11] Luc Hayward: so in theory it does
[2017/05/14, 14:56:15] Luc Hayward: but the memo says it doesnt
[2017/05/14, 14:56:58] Stuart Mesham: Yeah maybe just mistake in the memo but might be worth checking since they probably update their memos if people complain/they find a mistake
[2017/05/14, 14:58:12] Luc Hayward: dno
[2017/05/14, 14:59:23] Stuart Mesham: You send Maria an email because I sent one to pull out of the competition 😄
[2017/05/14, 15:12:56] Luc Hayward: eh
[2017/05/15, 16:53:02] Luc Hayward: Come study
[2017/05/15, 16:55:02] Stuart Mesham: I'm in one of the little study things, where are you?
[2017/05/15, 16:56:18] Luc Hayward: In the main library?
[2017/05/15, 16:58:10] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'll have to move though because we can't both work here
[2017/05/15, 16:58:40] Stuart Mesham: Where are you?
[2017/05/15, 16:59:03] Luc Hayward: Why?  I'm chilling for a bit. Will message you now
[2017/05/15, 17:01:35] Stuart Mesham: I want to eat
[2017/05/15, 17:01:43] Luc Hayward: Where?
[2017/05/15, 17:03:36] Stuart Mesham: Same old?
[2017/05/15, 17:03:45] Luc Hayward: They're closed
[2017/05/15, 17:04:05] Stuart Mesham: Or do you want to chill at the place in Leslie Social before we go in?
[2017/05/15, 17:04:17] Luc Hayward: Probably chill there
[2017/05/15, 17:04:39] Stuart Mesham: Let's go chill there and then last bit of cramming if we feel like it
[2017/05/15, 17:04:54] Luc Hayward: Ok ill come in 15
[2017/05/15, 17:05:19] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm going there now
[2017/05/15, 17:12:20] Luc Hayward: I'm coming now
[2017/05/15, 17:15:35] Luc Hayward: Where you
[2017/05/16, 19:40:46] Luc Hayward: Good old to gear
[2017/05/16, 19:40:48] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/kUhB0JKjJrQ
[2017/05/17, 10:07:48] Luc Hayward: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8uMx2tv05SbZkMxY3dDMDU1WHM?usp=sharing
[2017/05/17, 14:00:33] Stuart Mesham: For question 1 (chef tut) are we just drawing a diagram (not adding any numbers)?
[2017/05/17, 14:00:42] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/05/17, 14:00:53] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/05/17, 14:01:06] Luc Hayward: Shall I grab your bio prac test for you?
[2017/05/17, 14:01:20] Stuart Mesham: Yes please!
[2017/05/17, 14:01:52] Luc Hayward: Ok ill get it now now
[2017/05/17, 14:02:12] Stuart Mesham: Dankie
[2017/05/17, 17:00:55] Luc Hayward: Don't you want to be amazing and send me your chemisty write up outline ?
[2017/05/17, 17:01:03] Luc Hayward: Not the actual data and conclusion
[2017/05/17, 17:01:12] Luc Hayward: Just the format of it and the tables ?
[2017/05/17, 17:13:05] Stuart Mesham: Soz didn't see/feel it ringing
[2017/05/17, 17:15:13] Luc Hayward: it's chilled it isnt urgent
[2017/05/17, 17:36:32] Luc Hayward: but seriously
[2017/05/17, 17:36:35] Luc Hayward: will you?
[2017/05/17, 17:36:37] Luc Hayward: or no?
[2017/05/17, 17:38:23] Stuart Mesham: I'm afraid all my calculations are quite entrenched in the table (like even in the column/row headings)
[2017/05/17, 17:38:50] Luc Hayward: those are the same as everyone's though the formulae
[2017/05/17, 17:39:03] Stuart Mesham: So you'd literally just be getting an empty table and some beautiful merged cells
[2017/05/17, 17:39:23] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/05/17, 17:39:38] Stuart Mesham: I can send that if you want 😂
[2017/05/17, 17:40:05] Luc Hayward: no if everything you did is specific to you that fine
[2017/05/17, 17:41:22] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it is sorry
[2017/05/17, 17:41:50] Stuart Mesham: Lot's of the calculations are like in the middle of the titles/units
[2017/05/17, 17:43:12] Luc Hayward: kk
[2017/05/17, 17:43:24] Luc Hayward: how far back in terrys stuff do we go
[2017/05/17, 17:44:11] Stuart Mesham: I haven't started yet, I just got back from my maths tut and finished my Chem tut
[2017/05/17, 17:44:29] Luc Hayward: yes but surely you know how far back to go
[2017/05/17, 17:46:09] Luc Hayward: i think its powerpoint 3 onwards
[2017/05/17, 17:46:21] Luc Hayward: so everything after dna replication
[2017/05/17, 17:46:52] Luc Hayward: mendelian genetics onward.
[2017/05/17, 17:49:07] Luc Hayward: 6500 words for his summary of powerpoint 3
[2017/05/17, 17:49:22] Luc Hayward: powerpoint 3 - 6 are
[2017/05/17, 17:50:08] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/05/17, 17:50:34] Luc Hayward: 368 slides from terry
[2017/05/17, 17:50:34] Stuart Mesham: 😦
[2017/05/17, 17:50:41] Stuart Mesham: :(
[2017/05/17, 17:50:49] Stuart Mesham: Dammit bio
[2017/05/17, 17:52:05] Luc Hayward: if you include adam's notes it becomes 415
[2017/05/17, 20:19:31] Luc Hayward: Fuck Terry
[2017/05/17, 20:33:18] Stuart Mesham: Yes
[2017/05/17, 20:33:27] Stuart Mesham: Fuck Terry 😂
[2017/05/17, 20:47:18] Luc Hayward: How far are you
[2017/05/17, 20:48:06] Stuart Mesham: I'm nowhere, I just went through Mendelian genetics and I'm gonna shower now
[2017/05/17, 20:48:25] Luc Hayward: I'm thinking to call fuck this soon
[2017/05/17, 20:48:34] Stuart Mesham: I'll just let the intense stress happen tomorrow
[2017/05/17, 20:48:39] Stuart Mesham: Where are you?
[2017/05/17, 20:48:47] Luc Hayward: About halfway
[2017/05/17, 20:50:36] Luc Hayward: Just finished lecture 4
[2017/05/17, 20:51:02] Luc Hayward: Chromosomal inheritance
[2017/05/17, 20:51:14] Luc Hayward: Still have all of Adams stuff
[2017/05/17, 20:51:52] Luc Hayward: Plus half of Terry's work. Molecular basis for inheritance and gene to protein
[2017/05/17, 20:56:57] Luc Hayward: Check out some stuff from Google I/O this year
[2017/05/17, 21:03:08] Stuart Mesham: I saw the video labelling one
[2017/05/17, 21:03:13] Stuart Mesham: It looked pretty cool
[2017/05/17, 21:03:26] Luc Hayward: Didn't see that
[2017/05/17, 21:03:33] Luc Hayward: Google assistant coming to ios
[2017/05/17, 21:09:00] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/8kK2zwjRV0M
[2017/05/17, 21:09:02] Luc Hayward: this is hank
[2017/05/17, 21:09:07] Luc Hayward: he expains good stuff
[2017/05/17, 21:09:39] Stuart Mesham: Will check after my shower
[2017/05/17, 21:10:19] Stuart Mesham: I've resigned myself to failure 😄 🙁
[2017/05/17, 21:10:41] Luc Hayward: cool i need to catch up to you in marks
[2017/05/17, 21:10:50] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/05/17, 21:11:11] Luc Hayward: so this plan of yours sounds fantastic for me
[2017/05/17, 21:11:13] Stuart Mesham: What did you get for the last bio test?
[2017/05/17, 21:11:28] Luc Hayward: 50/60 something
[2017/05/17, 21:11:45] Stuart Mesham: Oh that's the same as me
[2017/05/17, 21:11:59] Luc Hayward: yeah but maths and chem
[2017/05/17, 21:12:24] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I love how Chem happened 😄
[2017/05/17, 21:12:43] Luc Hayward: i dont......
[2017/05/17, 21:13:21] Stuart Mesham: Ok shower time! 🎉
[2017/05/17, 21:13:30] Luc Hayward: chow
[2017/05/17, 21:13:30] Stuart Mesham: I'll cram all night tomorrow
[2017/05/17, 21:14:03] Stuart Mesham: Skip maths, physics and comp sci tomorrow 😄
[2017/05/17, 21:14:18] Luc Hayward: nooooo
[2017/05/17, 21:14:44] Stuart Mesham: Ok not maths
[2017/05/17, 21:14:56] Stuart Mesham: If we don't skip maths we'll fail bio
[2017/05/17, 21:15:04] Stuart Mesham: But if we do we'll fail maths and bio
[2017/05/17, 21:15:18] Luc Hayward: and maybe not comp sci she might be starting a new section and giving hints
[2017/05/17, 21:15:41] Stuart Mesham: Just watch the lecture video of comp sci 😄
[2017/05/17, 21:15:54] Stuart Mesham: Can speed it up
[2017/05/17, 21:17:26] Luc Hayward: new stuff
[2017/05/17, 21:17:34] Luc Hayward: quickly scanned todays lectuyre
[2017/05/17, 21:17:48] Luc Hayward: seems like stuff we know how to do but given a fancy name like porefix sum
[2017/05/17, 21:17:52] Luc Hayward: prefix
[2017/05/17, 21:18:41] Luc Hayward: I'm going to a bio tut tomorrow to recap how the fuck to do protein synthesis
[2017/05/17, 21:19:42] Stuart Mesham: I just had a thought
[2017/05/17, 21:20:07] Stuart Mesham: I've never ever gotten one of Adam's multiple choice questions right
[2017/05/17, 21:20:38] Luc Hayward: just means you understood after he explained it
[2017/05/17, 21:20:45] Luc Hayward: and you definitely have
[2017/05/17, 21:21:20] Stuart Mesham: Even if I just guessed I should've at least gotten one by one 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/05/17, 21:21:35] Stuart Mesham: I got today's one! 😃
[2017/05/17, 21:21:47] Stuart Mesham: By guessing 🙁
[2017/05/17, 21:22:04] Luc Hayward: you got the isotonic one too
[2017/05/17, 21:22:27] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah that one
[2017/05/17, 21:22:58] Luc Hayward: and you got them right during lectures
[2017/05/17, 21:23:11] Luc Hayward: just not alwaysa at the start
[2017/05/17, 21:23:31] Stuart Mesham: Thanks for the reassurance 😄
[2017/05/18, 09:49:18] Stuart Mesham: Let's go to the library
[2017/05/18, 09:50:56] Stuart Mesham: Actually to bio tut
[2017/05/18, 09:52:07] Stuart Mesham: Actually to library
[2017/05/18, 09:52:44] Luc Hayward: To
[2017/05/18, 09:52:45] Luc Hayward: Stu
[2017/05/18, 09:52:49] Luc Hayward: Ay
[2017/05/18, 09:52:53] Luc Hayward: Stu
[2017/05/18, 09:53:12] Luc Hayward: Come bio
[2017/05/18, 09:53:34] Luc Hayward: Come to the tut
[2017/05/18, 10:00:58] Stuart Mesham: Is it same as yesterdays?
[2017/05/18, 10:01:01] Stuart Mesham: *last time
[2017/05/18, 10:11:16] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/18, 10:11:42] Stuart Mesham: It's fine I mostly know that stuff and I'm a bit late now
[2017/05/18, 10:14:06] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/05/18, 10:14:41] Luc Hayward: I'll see you in the library keep your phone on so I can find yoh
[2017/05/18, 10:14:56] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/05/18, 10:36:37] Luc Hayward: K where you at
[2017/05/18, 10:37:49] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/05/18, 10:45:48] Stuart Mesham: I'm second floor in one of the studying blokkies, think I'm just gonna stay here because I'm on a productivity streak
[2017/05/18, 10:45:59] Luc Hayward: Kk
[2017/05/18, 10:54:00] Luc Hayward: Do you perform each experiment twice for chemistry??
[2017/05/18, 10:55:20] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/18, 11:30:19] Luc Hayward: In pairs? Like one of you does one reaction the other does the other?
[2017/05/18, 11:31:53] Stuart Mesham: Do you think we have to know stuff like Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome?
[2017/05/18, 11:32:14] Luc Hayward: Hmm I'd know that they exist?
[2017/05/18, 11:32:27] Stuart Mesham: Yeah or do them one after the other
[2017/05/18, 11:32:35] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/05/18, 11:55:46] Luc Hayward: Where you at

[2017/05/18, 12:52:40] Luc Hayward: Where you. Ow
[2017/05/18, 12:52:42] Luc Hayward: Now
[2017/05/18, 13:34:28] Stuart Mesham: Oh I'm at res
[2017/05/18, 16:01:06] Stuart Mesham: Are you out of your chem prac?
[2017/05/18, 16:03:35] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/18, 16:15:51] Stuart Mesham: Can we hangouts quick?
[2017/05/18, 16:15:58] Luc Hayward: Ye
[2017/05/18, 16:16:04] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/05/18, 17:26:58] Luc Hayward: how far you
[2017/05/18, 17:52:25] Stuart Mesham: Ugh not much further
[2017/05/18, 17:52:41] Luc Hayward: stu did you see the survey thing?
[2017/05/18, 17:52:47] Stuart Mesham: I went to have supper and then afterwards procrastinated until now
[2017/05/18, 17:52:52] Luc Hayward: https://ucpcommerce.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0BqnZkUzSAfhw4R
[2017/05/18, 17:52:54] Luc Hayward: this?
[2017/05/18, 17:52:55] Stuart Mesham: I'll check
[2017/05/18, 17:53:08] Luc Hayward: I'm doing one with keegan and then I'm going to see if i can do it again with you
[2017/05/18, 17:55:14] Stuart Mesham: It sounds so deep and potentially offensive 😂
[2017/05/18, 17:56:09] Stuart Mesham: But yeah I'll do that with you
[2017/05/18, 17:56:19] Luc Hayward: its loooong
[2017/05/18, 17:56:35] Luc Hayward: I'm goiong to try do it a few times
[2017/05/18, 17:58:03] Stuart Mesham: I'm pretty sure they don't want people to spam it 😄
[2017/05/18, 17:58:19] Luc Hayward: 150 rand
[2017/05/18, 17:58:21] Luc Hayward: its worth
[2017/05/18, 17:58:44] Luc Hayward: well I'm probably just past where you were when you called me
[2017/05/18, 17:59:20] Stuart Mesham: 150/hour is basically tutoring pay 😂
[2017/05/18, 17:59:29] Stuart Mesham: Except it's more boring
[2017/05/18, 17:59:32] Luc Hayward: basically
[2017/05/18, 17:59:59] Stuart Mesham: Idk if it's worth it just for the cash
[2017/05/18, 18:00:07] Luc Hayward: worth
[2017/05/18, 18:00:22] Stuart Mesham: Eeeeh
[2017/05/18, 18:00:53] Stuart Mesham: I'll do it anyway just because I'm curious now at what they could possibly ask
[2017/05/18, 18:15:37] Stuart Mesham: Remember August is for start ☝🏻
[2017/05/18, 18:15:42] Stuart Mesham: AUG
[2017/05/18, 18:16:06] Luc Hayward: in what way is august start?
[2017/05/18, 18:16:13] Luc Hayward: is that the start codon for transcription?
[2017/05/18, 18:16:21] Stuart Mesham: It's the start codon😂
[2017/05/18, 18:16:23] Stuart Mesham: Yea
[2017/05/18, 19:30:21] Stuart Mesham: I just finished Terry's section thank goodness 😳
[2017/05/18, 19:30:33] Stuart Mesham: Now my brain is fried
[2017/05/18, 19:32:33] Stuart Mesham: Gonna take a shower for half-time
[2017/05/18, 19:41:44] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/18, 19:56:19] Luc Hayward: Still trying. Literally dying. Staying to feel like we just call it quits
[2017/05/18, 19:56:33] Luc Hayward: B
[2017/05/18, 19:56:46] Stuart Mesham: Yay B
[2017/05/18, 19:57:07] Stuart Mesham: Terry's section is so hectic
[2017/05/18, 19:57:22] Luc Hayward: I don't think I can can carry on
[2017/05/18, 19:57:21] Stuart Mesham: Just overkill
[2017/05/18, 19:57:43] Luc Hayward: I posted through Terry's stuff in like an hour post hundred sides but now I'm dead
[2017/05/18, 19:57:52] Luc Hayward: Should have paced myself
[2017/05/18, 19:58:18] Stuart Mesham: Me half way through Terry's section 6 "Ok ok I've failed already please stop"
[2017/05/18, 19:58:46] Stuart Mesham: My head physically hurts 😂
[2017/05/18, 19:59:14] Stuart Mesham: I didn't know cramming could _actually_ hurt you
[2017/05/18, 20:00:02] Luc Hayward: right?
[2017/05/18, 20:00:16] Luc Hayward: this must be how the normies felt in high school
[2017/05/18, 20:00:48] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/05/18, 20:01:28] Stuart Mesham: Uni bio is so intense
[2017/05/18, 20:02:16] Luc Hayward: plan is now
[2017/05/18, 20:02:24] Luc Hayward: finish terry's last 30 slides
[2017/05/18, 20:02:18] Stuart Mesham: Want to go back to my high school me thinking "bio is so hard" and be like "you ain't seen nothin' yet" 😄
[2017/05/18, 20:02:32] Luc Hayward: make note of everything that seemed important
[2017/05/18, 20:02:44] Luc Hayward: skim through adam's stuff because it's fresh in my mind
[2017/05/18, 20:02:53] Stuart Mesham: Then go to sleep
[2017/05/18, 20:03:10] Stuart Mesham: I started Adam's notes and they seem to go faster than Terry's
[2017/05/18, 20:03:13] Luc Hayward: then just make sure I have Sam's tuts
[2017/05/18, 20:03:15] Luc Hayward: go to bed
[2017/05/18, 20:03:42] Luc Hayward: and tomorrow between chemistry and bio e just go do past papers and example questions to death
[2017/05/18, 20:03:46] Luc Hayward: sound good?
[2017/05/18, 20:03:56] Stuart Mesham: Go to a bio tut right before the test 😂
[2017/05/18, 20:04:05] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that's what I was thinking
[2017/05/18, 20:04:24] Luc Hayward: nah it wasnt helpful to go again this week
[2017/05/18, 20:05:02] Stuart Mesham: I had a feeling
[2017/05/18, 20:05:28] Stuart Mesham: I could really use a re-run of the protein synthesis + bacteria tut from last week
[2017/05/18, 20:06:55] Luc Hayward: exactly
[2017/05/18, 20:07:39] Stuart Mesham: I oath bio is harder than engineering
[2017/05/18, 20:08:47] Luc Hayward: oath
[2017/05/18, 20:09:08] Luc Hayward: 12
[2017/05/18, 20:09:11] Luc Hayward: woops
[2017/05/18, 20:10:03] Stuart Mesham: Wha
[2017/05/18, 20:10:05] Stuart Mesham: 12?
[2017/05/18, 20:10:17] Luc Hayward: nvm
[2017/05/18, 20:52:46] Luc Hayward: Going to bed
[2017/05/19, 09:39:06] Luc Hayward: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:8e777f258e50f07fb778f6889ea4674a6c86300a&dn=Prometheus (2012) 1080p&tr=http://explodie.org:6969/announce&tr=http://p4p.arenabg.com:1337/announce&tr=http://tracker.acg.gg:1578/announce&tr=udp://mgtracker.org:2710/announce&tr=udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969/announce&tr=udp://tracker.zer0day.to:1337/announce
[2017/05/19, 11:58:34] Luc Hayward: Come here
[2017/05/19, 11:58:37] Luc Hayward: Stand with Vivi and i
[2017/05/20, 10:33:44] Stuart Mesham: What did you put for the aim of the bio prac?
[2017/05/20, 13:48:11] Luc Hayward: Doing it tomorrow
[2017/05/20, 13:48:52] Luc Hayward: Aim is to see the effect of enzyme exposure on reaction progress (word it better)
[2017/05/20, 13:49:09] Stuart Mesham: Something like that
[2017/05/20, 13:49:18] Luc Hayward: Ye
[2017/05/20, 13:49:25] Luc Hayward: You driving you two today?
[2017/05/20, 13:51:42] Luc Hayward: Either way, there's a bit of traffic on the m3 today so check google for the delay. Might be better to go via wetpups
[2017/05/20, 13:53:11] Stuart Mesham: Yeah thanks for the heads up
[2017/05/20, 13:53:37] Luc Hayward: Like easily adding 5/10 minutes minimum
[2017/05/20, 13:53:53] Luc Hayward: Maybe 15
[2017/05/20, 13:53:58] Stuart Mesham: Ok will go pick Chris up now
[2017/05/21, 12:05:46] Luc Hayward: wow i hate bio reports\
[2017/05/21, 12:20:35] Luc Hayward: also we start recursion this week
[2017/05/21, 12:21:07] Luc Hayward: probably be a good idea to go to lectures, i flew through the notes and there are some weird examples in there.
[2017/05/21, 12:21:57] Luc Hayward: Looks as though there are going to be cases where we have to write recursive functions for things that are probably easier to write iteratively (like going through strings and adding lists of numbers and stuff)
[2017/05/21, 14:06:04] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it's excruciating, isn't it 😬
[2017/05/21, 14:06:17] Luc Hayward: Its horrible!
[2017/05/21, 14:06:43] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I don't think we should skip _another_ week of comp sci. 😄
[2017/05/21, 14:07:00] Luc Hayward: yeah no
[2017/05/21, 14:07:06] Luc Hayward: have you finished bio
[2017/05/21, 14:07:20] Stuart Mesham: No I just finished the introduction 😂
[2017/05/21, 14:07:31] Luc Hayward: wooooow. Ok well it takes ages
[2017/05/21, 14:07:47] Stuart Mesham: Just a heads up, remember to finish Webassign 8 today
[2017/05/21, 14:08:02] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/21, 14:08:07] Luc Hayward: yeah i finished it already
[2017/05/21, 14:08:51] Luc Hayward: made dumb dumb errors(like giving things as decimals instead of fractions
[2017/05/21, 14:08:57] Luc Hayward: so i did quite bad in it
[2017/05/21, 14:10:18] Stuart Mesham: In Webassign 9 I couldn't get it to accept my last answer (even after reading the email on formatting (sinx)^2) and after typing it into Wolfram alpha which gave the exact same answer 😤
[2017/05/21, 14:10:48] Stuart Mesham: So I sent an ask-your-teacher message
[2017/05/21, 14:11:15] Luc Hayward: yeah i had one like that too
[2017/05/21, 14:19:20] Stuart Mesham: Infuriating
[2017/05/21, 14:19:29] Luc Hayward: oh well
[2017/05/21, 14:19:33] Luc Hayward: its only webassign
[2017/05/21, 14:19:49] Stuart Mesham: Today's been such an awful day 😂
[2017/05/21, 14:23:41] Luc Hayward: have you done anything?
[2017/05/21, 14:23:46] Luc Hayward: what did you do all mornign
[2017/05/21, 14:25:18] Stuart Mesham: A 250 word introduction, some emails and then 2 Webassigns 😭
[2017/05/21, 14:25:52] Luc Hayward: Its so long at the moment. What time did you start though? I know the. Webbassigns took me a stupid amount of time, did you also do this weeks one? Number 0
[2017/05/21, 14:33:38] Stuart Mesham: Number 9
[2017/05/21, 14:33:51] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/05/21, 14:34:01] Stuart Mesham: I started at 10 but lunch took about an hour
[2017/05/21, 14:34:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I did Webassign number 9
[2017/05/21, 14:34:48] Luc Hayward: ill probably do that after bio which is taking hours
[2017/05/21, 14:35:57] Stuart Mesham: My goodness I was going to go through maths and chem lectures and notes + watch comp sci lectures today. Now all that seems unlikely. 🙈
[2017/05/21, 14:36:24] Stuart Mesham: Also my bio pre-prac questions for tomorrow
[2017/05/21, 14:37:48] Luc Hayward: yeah i think all this is happening tomorrow and in the week
[2017/05/21, 14:41:04] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/21, 14:42:40] Luc Hayward: how much is one unit of alkaline phosphatase
[2017/05/21, 15:20:44] Stuart Mesham: The concentration of the solution?
[2017/05/21, 15:20:54] Luc Hayward: Nvm I worked it out\
[2017/05/21, 15:21:03] Stuart Mesham: What was your answer?
[2017/05/21, 15:21:26] Luc Hayward: For what? That? Oh I realized it wasn’t important to my discussion
[2017/05/21, 15:22:13] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/05/21, 15:24:19] Luc Hayward: I'm nearly done with bio if you want me to give you the link incase you want answers to stuff? I won't have my phone on me until like 8?
[2017/05/21, 15:24:46] Stuart Mesham: Nah it's chilled
[2017/05/21, 15:25:26] Stuart Mesham: I think I'll be fine
[2017/05/21, 15:28:46] Luc Hayward: cool thing
[2017/05/21, 15:28:50] Luc Hayward: see you tomorrow
[2017/05/21, 15:29:17] Stuart Mesham: Yeah see you 👍🏻
[2017/05/21, 15:30:08] Stuart Mesham: Wait where does Pi come into any of this??
[2017/05/21, 15:30:19] Luc Hayward: it doesnt
[2017/05/21, 15:30:21] Luc Hayward: >
[2017/05/21, 15:31:10] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/21, 15:31:22] Luc Hayward: uhm
[2017/05/21, 15:32:18] Stuart Mesham: Oh inorganic phosphate
[2017/05/21, 15:32:23] Luc Hayward: no clue
[2017/05/21, 15:32:25] Luc Hayward: it isntPi
[2017/05/21, 15:32:39] Stuart Mesham: Pinorganic
[2017/05/21, 15:32:40] Luc Hayward: its probably the inorganic phosphate
[2017/05/21, 15:32:43] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/05/21, 15:32:52] Stuart Mesham: Cool
[2017/05/21, 17:31:20] Stuart Mesham: Did you do scatter plot or line graph? (Not for standard curve but for the other ones)
[2017/05/21, 17:32:26] Luc Hayward: A couple
[2017/05/21, 17:33:04] Stuart Mesham: ?
[2017/05/21, 17:34:02] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/21, 17:41:30] Luc Hayward: Bar
[2017/05/21, 18:06:59] Stuart Mesham: Cool, thanks. And did you ignore the volume of NaOH when you calculate the enzyme activity? (So without the NaOH the total volume in each test tube (for the first reaction) is 2ml)
[2017/05/21, 18:10:09] Luc Hayward: Do I need volume at all??
[2017/05/21, 18:10:19] Luc Hayward: Why do I need volume
[2017/05/21, 18:10:32] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/05/21, 18:10:34] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/05/21, 18:10:38] Luc Hayward: I ignored it
[2017/05/21, 18:10:50] Luc Hayward: I think
[2017/05/21, 18:10:52] Luc Hayward: Not sure
[2017/05/21, 18:11:03] Luc Hayward: Probably did something wrong because I just ignored volume
[2017/05/21, 18:11:53] Stuart Mesham: Oh never mind, I see now you can just divide concentration by time to get activity since activity is μmoles/ml/min and concentration is μmoles/ml
[2017/05/21, 18:12:14] Stuart Mesham: So maybe you don't need volume?
[2017/05/21, 18:12:21] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/21, 18:12:24] Luc Hayward: I did that
[2017/05/21, 18:12:34] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks
[2017/05/21, 18:36:03] Stuart Mesham: When it says "explain why this should be so" for the difference between the enzyme activities when there is and isn't inorganic phosphate added , how much detail do you think we need to go into there?
[2017/05/21, 18:37:16] Stuart Mesham: As in do you think we have to give a detailed explanation of how it is inhibited or just say "Its inhibited by inorganic phosphate." and then print and go to sleep?
[2017/05/21, 18:39:11] Luc Hayward: i just zaid inorganic phosphate is an inhibitor and creates a negative feedback loop resulting in the enzymes activity being strictly controlled in order to maintain an optimal inorganic phosphate level in an organism
[2017/05/21, 18:39:49] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'll just say that too
[2017/05/21, 18:40:00] Luc Hayward: cool
[2017/05/21, 19:23:11] Stuart Mesham: Did you have any references to site in your discussion?
[2017/05/21, 19:37:00] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/05/21, 19:37:53] Stuart Mesham: Ok me neither
[2017/05/22, 17:34:57] Luc Hayward: You get Comp sci back yet?
[2017/05/22, 17:49:07] Stuart Mesham: I'll check later
[2017/05/22, 18:05:17] Luc Hayward: Did you understand his stuff today on sinx/x as x->0
[2017/05/22, 18:06:17] Stuart Mesham: He explained that last lecture as a pre-requisite for today's lectue
[2017/05/22, 18:07:01] Luc Hayward: Yeah but not super well
[2017/05/22, 18:07:02] Stuart Mesham: All the stuff he did today was based on the assumption of sinx/x as x->0 which he must've proved in a previous lecture
[2017/05/22, 18:07:11] Luc Hayward: Yeah I know
[2017/05/22, 18:07:20] Luc Hayward: Did you understand his manipulations though
[2017/05/22, 18:07:27] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/22, 18:07:29] Luc Hayward: Like I have this now
[2017/05/22, 18:07:44] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/22, 18:07:56] Stuart Mesham: I'm 95% sure he's building up to show us L'Hopital's rule
[2017/05/22, 18:08:11] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/22, 18:08:52] Stuart Mesham: Change​ it to 3x/sin3x
[2017/05/22, 18:09:14] Stuart Mesham: Multiplied by 7x/3x
[2017/05/22, 18:10:11] Luc Hayward: Did that
[2017/05/22, 18:10:34] Luc Hayward: How do I flip it over though
[2017/05/22, 18:11:02] Stuart Mesham: Divide one by it
[2017/05/22, 18:11:47] Stuart Mesham: Then multiply by something to make it stay the same
[2017/05/22, 18:12:19] Stuart Mesham: *re-write as 1 divided by the flipped over version
[2017/05/22, 18:12:30] Stuart Mesham: Then you can use the sinx/x thing
[2017/05/22, 18:13:05] Luc Hayward: But then I will have sin3x/3x, is that the same
[2017/05/22, 18:13:23] Luc Hayward: No nvm
[2017/05/22, 18:13:25] Luc Hayward: That was dumb
[2017/05/22, 18:13:33] Luc Hayward: It's obviously tending to three
[2017/05/22, 18:13:33] Stuart Mesham: Have you got it?
[2017/05/22, 18:13:45] Luc Hayward: Hmm I'll show you now
[2017/05/22, 18:14:00] Stuart Mesham: No it's fine I know how to it 😂
[2017/05/22, 18:14:08] Stuart Mesham: *do
[2017/05/22, 18:14:43] Luc Hayward: No that doesn't help...
[2017/05/22, 18:14:57] Luc Hayward: Can you hangours
[2017/05/22, 18:14:57] Stuart Mesham: I'll write it, hold on
[2017/05/22, 18:15:12] Luc Hayward: I think I'm just missing your point here
[2017/05/22, 18:15:17] Stuart Mesham: I'll just send a pic when I've written it and then it'll make sense
[2017/05/22, 18:15:28] Luc Hayward: No it won't 😂
[2017/05/22, 18:15:47] Stuart Mesham: It will, trust
[2017/05/22, 18:16:18] Luc Hayward: If I divide 1 by 3x/sin3x, then to fix that I have to multiply by sin3x/x which isn't helpful because then I'm still stuck with it as a term?
[2017/05/22, 18:16:19] Luc Hayward: Surely
[2017/05/22, 18:16:37] Stuart Mesham: Wait for it...
[2017/05/22, 18:17:32] Luc Hayward: I've clearly made a mistake here
[2017/05/22, 18:17:39] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/22, 18:20:21] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/22, 18:21:33] Stuart Mesham: Hint: the final answer should be 7/3 😄
[2017/05/22, 18:22:04] Stuart Mesham: That I just know from cheating using L'Hopital's rule
[2017/05/22, 18:22:31] Luc Hayward: Can't remember it's been so long 😂
[2017/05/22, 18:22:52] Stuart Mesham: Does the picture I sent make sense?
[2017/05/22, 18:22:59] Luc Hayward: Reading
[2017/05/22, 18:24:36] Stuart Mesham: The rule is that whenever you have a limit that approaches 0/0 or ∞/∞ or -∞/∞ etc. then it's the same as the limit of the derivative of the top over the derivative of the bottom
[2017/05/22, 18:25:08] Stuart Mesham: The cheating rule
[2017/05/22, 18:25:11] Luc Hayward: Yeah I did that
[2017/05/22, 18:25:15] Luc Hayward: What you wrote
[2017/05/22, 18:25:37] Luc Hayward: But you need to surely multiply by whatever you divide by
[2017/05/22, 18:25:38] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/05/22, 18:25:40] Luc Hayward: Wait
[2017/05/22, 18:25:42] Luc Hayward: I see
[2017/05/22, 18:25:42] Stuart Mesham: Yeah then you get 7/3 x 1/1
[2017/05/22, 18:26:24] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/05/22, 18:26:34] Luc Hayward: How is it
[2017/05/22, 18:26:35] Luc Hayward: Nvm
[2017/05/22, 18:26:44] Luc Hayward: Forgot to write 3x I wrote x
[2017/05/22, 18:26:45] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/05/22, 18:26:48] Luc Hayward: I understand
[2017/05/22, 18:26:54] Stuart Mesham: Ok 👍🏻
[2017/05/22, 18:27:21] Stuart Mesham: Now back to this infernal flow diagram
[2017/05/22, 18:29:07] Luc Hayward: Do you mean when the limit as x tends to 0 is 0/0 or infinity over infinity, then you can write that limit as the derived of the top over the derived of the bottom?(not the limit of the deriv of the bottom)
[2017/05/22, 18:29:14] Luc Hayward: For chem?
[2017/05/22, 18:29:49] Stuart Mesham: Yeah ☹️
[2017/05/22, 18:30:41] Stuart Mesham: So it equals lim x-> 0 of (f'(x)/g'(x))
[2017/05/22, 18:32:34] Stuart Mesham: So for your question it would be lim x->0 (7/3cos(3x))
[2017/05/22, 18:32:55] Stuart Mesham: Which = 7/3
[2017/05/22, 18:33:33] Stuart Mesham: *7/(3cos(3x))
[2017/05/22, 18:39:48] Luc Hayward: ok i understand
[2017/05/22, 18:39:49] Luc Hayward: thanks
[2017/05/22, 18:40:35] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/05/22, 19:48:43] Stuart Mesham: Can you help me with some bio?
[2017/05/22, 19:50:01] Luc Hayward: Sure
[2017/05/22, 19:51:01] Stuart Mesham: ‎Missed Video Call
[2017/05/22, 19:51:06] Luc Hayward: Can't call
[2017/05/22, 19:51:08] Luc Hayward: Can whatsapp
[2017/05/22, 19:51:12] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok
[2017/05/22, 19:51:17] Luc Hayward: Sorry
[2017/05/22, 19:51:59] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/22, 19:52:12] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/05/22, 19:52:24] Luc Hayward: Are you studying??
[2017/05/22, 19:52:28] Stuart Mesham: What was the deal there with "repeating 3 times" etc.
[2017/05/22, 19:52:48] Stuart Mesham: I lost the plot completely in today's lecture at that point
[2017/05/22, 19:52:55] Stuart Mesham: I just want to be on track for tomorrow
[2017/05/22, 19:53:20] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/05/22, 19:54:11] Stuart Mesham: Because he did some "go around 3 times thing" and then drew an arrow up from G3P to RuBP (on the left)
[2017/05/22, 19:54:41] Stuart Mesham: When he got 15C on the bottom left
[2017/05/22, 19:54:55] Luc Hayward: I've no idea
[2017/05/22, 19:54:56] Stuart Mesham: And at the top on the left
[2017/05/22, 19:55:02] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/05/22, 19:55:38] Luc Hayward: He was showing how the carbons and CO2 move around
[2017/05/22, 19:55:54] Luc Hayward: And why you need 3co2 in for every g3p out
[2017/05/22, 19:56:41] Stuart Mesham: So why exactly do you need 3co2 in for every g3p out? 😂
[2017/05/22, 19:57:42] Stuart Mesham: Ok actually I see why you need that but then what was going on with his convert back to rubp at the end?
[2017/05/22, 19:58:39] Luc Hayward: Isn't it one of the reacting molecules
[2017/05/22, 20:00:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but remember at the end, half of the G3P goes back into the cycle
[2017/05/22, 20:00:21] Stuart Mesham: *some
[2017/05/22, 20:00:26] Stuart Mesham: I think it's half
[2017/05/22, 20:02:31] Luc Hayward: Hmm
[2017/05/22, 20:02:33] Luc Hayward: Ask him
[2017/05/22, 20:02:58] Stuart Mesham: "Sorry I didn't get it, please do it again" 😂
[2017/05/22, 20:03:21] Stuart Mesham: Maybe I should ask Sam
[2017/05/22, 20:03:47] Stuart Mesham: Actually after the lecture tomorrow I'll ask Adam
[2017/05/22, 20:05:08] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/22, 20:05:19] Luc Hayward: I'm going to him tomorrow too so that would work really well
[2017/05/22, 20:05:40] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool
[2017/05/22, 20:11:20] Luc Hayward: I think the only way to net g3p is by reacting co2 and rubp
[2017/05/22, 20:11:35] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/22, 20:12:08] Stuart Mesham: But then he said at then end some g3p is converted into rubp and goes back into the cycle
[2017/05/22, 20:13:01] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/22, 20:13:04] Stuart Mesham: So in this picture on the board he drew an arrow from bottom left to top left
[2017/05/22, 20:13:08] Luc Hayward: G3p can't react
[2017/05/22, 20:13:14] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/22, 20:13:23] Luc Hayward: I think you're missing some explanation in that there drawing
[2017/05/22, 20:13:28] Luc Hayward: User the one in the back
[2017/05/22, 20:14:14] Stuart Mesham: Oh that's it
[2017/05/22, 20:14:29] Stuart Mesham: That's a more in-depth version of it
[2017/05/22, 20:17:45] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/23, 10:56:38] Luc Hayward: You ditched us the fuck!
[2017/05/23, 20:29:38] Stuart Mesham: Are we supposed to _not_ explicitly list the materials for the bio practical report in the method and materials section?
[2017/05/23, 20:30:01] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/05/23, 20:30:05] Luc Hayward: Don't just list them
[2017/05/23, 20:30:52] Stuart Mesham: I didn't just list them. I did write a paragraph explaining what to do but will they take marks off for also having a materials list before it?
[2017/05/23, 20:31:30] Luc Hayward: Yeah you mustn't have a list apparently
[2017/05/23, 20:32:20] Stuart Mesham: Also, in some procrastination I found out that you can get a netbeans plugin for scene builder so you can make your UI inside of netbeans like swing
[2017/05/23, 20:32:29] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/05/23, 20:36:54] Stuart Mesham: Except I didn't try download it because I needed to stop procrastinating
[2017/05/23, 20:37:32] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/05/23, 20:37:44] Luc Hayward: Doesn't help you though? Like what difference does it make
[2017/05/23, 20:38:17] Stuart Mesham: So your IDE can be an IDE 😄
[2017/05/23, 20:38:34] Stuart Mesham: So you don't have to keep switching between programs
[2017/05/23, 20:38:52] Luc Hayward: You're still going to be creating fxml files
[2017/05/23, 20:39:34] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but you can just click on the XML file and then the scene builder UI shows up in the editing space
[2017/05/23, 20:39:37] Luc Hayward: Yeah but sometimes you do need more than one program
[2017/05/23, 20:39:52] Stuart Mesham: But you try to avoid that 😄
[2017/05/23, 20:39:59] Stuart Mesham: Because it's a pain
[2017/05/23, 20:40:30] Luc Hayward: But you don't want your UI design in the way of your programming
[2017/05/23, 20:40:48] Luc Hayward: That's like wanting a ide within unity
[2017/05/23, 20:41:36] Stuart Mesham: No making the UI for a normal program is different to making a scene for a game
[2017/05/23, 20:41:55] Stuart Mesham: It's nice to be able to see your UI easily
[2017/05/23, 20:41:56] Luc Hayward: They should both be seperate
[2017/05/23, 20:41:59] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/23, 20:42:02] Luc Hayward: You can
[2017/05/23, 20:42:12] Stuart Mesham: Nah they should be the same 😄
[2017/05/23, 20:42:42] Luc Hayward: Sometimes I just want to work on my UI without opening a full ide
[2017/05/23, 20:43:00] Luc Hayward: Especially when I'm working on 2 screens
[2017/05/23, 20:43:02] Stuart Mesham: What a weirdo 😂
[2017/05/23, 20:43:39] Stuart Mesham: Oh well it seems like we aren't going to agree here 😄
[2017/05/23, 20:44:53] Luc Hayward: Besides does the plugin allow for any version of scene builder?
[2017/05/23, 20:45:00] Luc Hayward: Eh I don't see it being useful to me
[2017/05/23, 20:45:12] Luc Hayward: But that's the thing if it works for you then use it 😂👍🏻
[2017/05/23, 20:45:50] Stuart Mesham: I think the plugin is a standalone thing so you don't even need scene builder installed
[2017/05/23, 20:46:23] Stuart Mesham: But swing definitely does seem better than swing for making big programs
[2017/05/23, 20:46:39] Stuart Mesham: Really overkill for prototyping stuff though
[2017/05/23, 20:47:08] Stuart Mesham: I think I'll still use swing for my little projects even after I've learnt javafx
[2017/05/23, 20:47:29] Stuart Mesham: *javafx is better than swing 🙈
[2017/05/23, 20:48:06] Luc Hayward: So basically it's not even the most recent scene builder it could be super old??
[2017/05/23, 20:48:14] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/05/23, 20:48:43] Stuart Mesham: It's an official one made by the same people so I think it's the latest version
[2017/05/23, 20:49:14] Stuart Mesham: Called gluon plugin
[2017/05/23, 20:49:31] Luc Hayward: I've heard of it
[2017/05/23, 20:49:39] Stuart Mesham: I see if you go to the plugins menu on NetBeans it's there
[2017/05/23, 20:49:43] Luc Hayward: Eh if it helps you, use it
[2017/05/23, 20:49:58] Stuart Mesham: I'll look at it another time
[2017/05/23, 20:51:39] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/05/23, 21:12:35] Stuart Mesham: Do you happen to have something on hand I can reference to explain what enzyme inhibition means? :)
[2017/05/23, 21:12:53] Stuart Mesham: Something reputable
[2017/05/23, 21:12:56] Luc Hayward: Why do you need to reference it?
[2017/05/23, 21:13:09] Luc Hayward: How can you still be doing your bio prac from last week
[2017/05/23, 21:13:24] Stuart Mesham: Because we need to reference everything :(
[2017/05/23, 21:13:35] Stuart Mesham: It's due tomorrow
[2017/05/23, 21:13:36] Luc Hayward: Reference the textbook
[2017/05/23, 21:13:41] Luc Hayward: How?
[2017/05/23, 21:13:48] Luc Hayward: Mine was due yesterday
[2017/05/23, 21:13:52] Stuart Mesham: Textbook it is
[2017/05/23, 21:14:09] Luc Hayward: And I didn't reference shit because I never had to look things up
[2017/05/23, 21:14:10] Stuart Mesham: Ours was due 48 hours after the bio prac
[2017/05/23, 21:14:21] Luc Hayward: Yeah.... Last week's prac?
[2017/05/23, 21:15:38] Stuart Mesham: No this week
[2017/05/23, 21:15:41] Stuart Mesham: Have you done the peer review workshop?
[2017/05/23, 21:15:53] Luc Hayward: No mine is tomorrow
[2017/05/23, 21:16:03] Luc Hayward: You said nothing to do prior to the pad
[2017/05/23, 21:16:04] Luc Hayward: Prac
[2017/05/23, 21:16:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah prior
[2017/05/23, 21:16:37] Stuart Mesham: Afterward you got 48 hours to hand the report in
[2017/05/23, 21:16:39] Luc Hayward: And after?
[2017/05/23, 21:17:06] Luc Hayward: How was it?
[2017/05/23, 21:17:12] Luc Hayward: Fuck that's going to be hard
[2017/05/23, 21:17:23] Luc Hayward: Means bio and chem are both due on a Friday for me
[2017/05/23, 21:17:35] Luc Hayward: Going to have to discuss this with my demonstrator
[2017/05/23, 21:39:24] Stuart Mesham: Yeah mine are both due tomorrow 🙈
[2017/05/23, 21:39:40] Luc Hayward: Rip you. How was bio and chem
[2017/05/23, 21:40:02] Stuart Mesham: The chem was super chilled
[2017/05/23, 21:40:17] Stuart Mesham: The bio was quite boring but kinda necessary
[2017/05/23, 21:40:38] Luc Hayward: Right. And time wise in terms of finishing the reports?
[2017/05/23, 21:40:38] Stuart Mesham: In bio you peer-review each other's practical reports
[2017/05/23, 21:40:54] Luc Hayward: Shit but my table are dumb af
[2017/05/23, 21:41:29] Stuart Mesham: Well you have to have the report finished by the practical so that the others can read it and then you get 48 hours to make changes and hand in
[2017/05/23, 21:41:33] Stuart Mesham: So it's not that bad
[2017/05/23, 21:42:08] Luc Hayward: Stu. My bio prac report is done I handed it in on Sunday
[2017/05/23, 21:43:40] Stuart Mesham: Oh you're only meant to hand in after you've had it peer-reviewed 😄
[2017/05/23, 21:44:02] Luc Hayward: Stu are you even doing the same pracs as I am
[2017/05/23, 21:44:16] Luc Hayward: We have in a digital copy
[2017/05/23, 21:44:32] Luc Hayward: And bring a hard copy to this week's prac
[2017/05/23, 21:44:46] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but you need a hard copy for this prac
[2017/05/23, 21:44:57] Stuart Mesham: Where even is the hand in thing on Vula?
[2017/05/23, 21:44:59] Luc Hayward: Yeah I have that in my folder for tomorrow
[2017/05/23, 21:45:06] Luc Hayward: You email your dem
[2017/05/23, 21:45:33] Stuart Mesham: Oh the demonstrator I was with said you hand in on Turnitin somehow
[2017/05/23, 21:45:52] Luc Hayward: Oh no we don't do that for this prac
[2017/05/23, 21:50:09] Stuart Mesham: We do, I heard it straight from the horse's mouth!
[2017/05/23, 21:50:20] Luc Hayward: I didnt
[2017/05/23, 21:50:28] Luc Hayward: Emailed my dem and got instant response
[2017/05/23, 21:50:37] Stuart Mesham: Which was?
[2017/05/23, 21:50:48] Luc Hayward: Thanks got it
[2017/05/23, 21:51:03] Luc Hayward: If she wanted something else she could have emailed me back to say it was missing something
[2017/05/23, 21:51:16] Stuart Mesham: That's weird
[2017/05/23, 21:51:22] Luc Hayward: Very
[2017/05/23, 21:51:42] Stuart Mesham: Then the peer review workshop is mostly pointless for you
[2017/05/23, 21:52:09] Luc Hayward: I don't understand though like the Dems and Adam said this week we definitely email directly to them
[2017/05/23, 22:30:21] Stuart Mesham: They're really confused
[2017/05/23, 22:31:51] Stuart Mesham: Maybe it was just a thing that the specific demonstrator I was with wanted (my normal demonstrator wasn't there)
[2017/05/24, 06:45:53] Luc Hayward: Bring me a lab coat today if I need one please for the bio orac
[2017/05/24, 06:47:03] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/05/24, 06:47:53] Luc Hayward: Do I need one?
[2017/05/24, 06:48:46] Stuart Mesham: I don't think so if you're doing the same as mine but just take one in case they decide to be difficult
[2017/05/24, 07:02:11] Luc Hayward: Ok thanks
[2017/05/24, 09:17:00] Luc Hayward: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8uMx2tv05SbdHZ2VTVqVGJaTzQ
[2017/05/24, 10:46:59] Luc Hayward: Ffs faith and George beat us in comp sci
[2017/05/24, 10:47:12] Luc Hayward: This some bullshit
[2017/05/24, 13:31:44] Luc Hayward: How long will bio take
[2017/05/24, 14:54:33] Stuart Mesham: A bit long, I'm afraid 😄
[2017/05/24, 14:56:37] Luc Hayward: Doesn't seem so bad
[2017/05/24, 15:15:24] Luc Hayward: Done
[2017/05/24, 16:12:05] Stuart Mesham: Fuck I can only get extra time in second semester
[2017/05/24, 16:14:55] Stuart Mesham: It's gonna look like I'm really stupid after our exams
[2017/05/24, 16:50:08] Stuart Mesham: Ok I've changed my opinion, javafx is just better in every way
[2017/05/24, 18:49:44] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/05/24, 18:51:37] Stuart Mesham: I learnt how to use it 😂
[2017/05/24, 18:51:38] Stuart Mesham: It's not actually that bad
[2017/05/24, 18:51:53] Stuart Mesham: They stopped accepting 1st semester extra time applications on the 20th of April 😭
[2017/05/24, 18:51:55] Luc Hayward: Yeah it isn't such a huge mission
[2017/05/24, 18:52:10] Luc Hayward: But it definitely is quite conplex for simple things
[2017/05/24, 18:52:52] Stuart Mesham: It's more effort than swing for if you just want to make a text field and a button but not _that_ much more work 😄
[2017/05/24, 18:53:08] Luc Hayward: Exactly
[2017/05/24, 18:53:44] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/05/24, 18:54:49] Stuart Mesham: Since when were we planning on doing that?? 😂
[2017/05/24, 18:55:54] Stuart Mesham: But anyway imma try make the web reciever thing now
[2017/05/24, 18:58:38] Luc Hayward: We weren't
[2017/05/24, 18:58:39] Luc Hayward: Ever
[2017/05/24, 19:39:10] Stuart Mesham: Eyy it's ready
[2017/05/24, 19:39:18] Luc Hayward: Really?
[2017/05/24, 19:39:30] Stuart Mesham: https://websaver.000webhostapp.com/addToDB.php?input=lucsinput
[2017/05/24, 19:39:36] Stuart Mesham: https://websaver.000webhostapp.com/showInputs.php
[2017/05/24, 19:39:45] Stuart Mesham: There you go!
[2017/05/24, 19:39:53] Luc Hayward: 😂 show me sometime
[2017/05/24, 19:39:56] Stuart Mesham: Just replace lucsinput with the input
[2017/05/24, 19:40:34] Stuart Mesham: There'll be a python built in method for formatting strings for URLs so that spaces etc. work
[2017/05/24, 19:40:44] Stuart Mesham: Click on the second one to see the inputs
[2017/05/24, 19:40:57] Luc Hayward: Yeah I know
[2017/05/24, 19:41:06] Stuart Mesham: I noticed the time is in the wrong timezone
[2017/05/24, 19:41:19] Luc Hayward: Who cares
[2017/05/24, 19:41:38] Stuart Mesham: But yeeeeah take that automarker 😎🤘🏻
[2017/05/24, 19:41:44] Luc Hayward: Fuck yeah
[2017/05/24, 19:41:58] Luc Hayward: Will you explain to me how it works and how you did it?
[2017/05/24, 19:42:01] Stuart Mesham: Notice the dodgy host I used 😂
[2017/05/24, 19:42:06] Stuart Mesham: Yeah sure
[2017/05/24, 19:42:18] Stuart Mesham: After supper though 😂
[2017/05/24, 19:42:57] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/24, 19:43:02] Luc Hayward: Or like in comp sci
[2017/05/24, 19:44:56] Stuart Mesham: Yeah or then because sleep 👍🏻
[2017/05/24, 19:47:23] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/24, 20:41:29] Luc Hayward: Teach me how this is done tomorrow?
[2017/05/24, 21:05:59] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/05/24, 21:06:38] Luc Hayward: Cool👌🏻👌🏻
[2017/05/24, 21:08:06] Stuart Mesham: Check the inputs page now, I just tested it on assignment 7 acronyms.py 😄
[2017/05/24, 21:09:03] Luc Hayward: Suite me tomorrow😂 sleep is life
[2017/05/24, 21:09:06] Luc Hayward: Show
[2017/05/24, 21:09:18] Stuart Mesham: Ok 😂
[2017/05/24, 21:10:37] Luc Hayward: Very interested to learn
[2017/05/24, 21:10:47] Luc Hayward: Finally understood that stupid towers of Hanoi thing
[2017/05/24, 21:11:20] Luc Hayward: I didn't realise that everyone it called itself, it was changing the source and destination poles around
[2017/05/24, 21:11:51] Stuart Mesham: Just click the link quickly though it's beautiful. All those mysterious pesky inputs exposed in broad daylight! 😄
[2017/05/24, 21:12:03] Stuart Mesham: Look for like 2 seconds then go to sleep 😄
[2017/05/24, 21:12:25] Stuart Mesham: Awesome
[2017/05/24, 21:12:33] Luc Hayward: Looks good
[2017/05/24, 21:13:02] Stuart Mesham: Wohoo 😄
[2017/05/24, 21:14:13] Luc Hayward: Honestly have no idea what you're doing beyond the vague idea that when you follow the link to submit input, a php script takes everything after the input stage and inserts it into a database. Then the other URL runs a php script that causes the database select all statement to be shown I suppose??
[2017/05/24, 21:14:49] Stuart Mesham: Yeah exactly that
[2017/05/24, 21:14:53] Luc Hayward: No Como sci lecture tomorrow
[2017/05/24, 21:15:00] Stuart Mesham: Damn 😂
[2017/05/24, 21:15:06] Luc Hayward: Maybe you can show me how it's all done then?
[2017/05/24, 21:15:20] Stuart Mesham: Yeah sure 👍🏻
[2017/05/24, 21:15:42] Stuart Mesham: It's exactly this ^^
[2017/05/24, 21:16:02] Luc Hayward: Seeing as we have a free. And you can tell me all about your conversion to javafx and how and why I should like it again
[2017/05/24, 21:17:16] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/24, 21:18:53] Luc Hayward: I think I know what to do in the challenge questions
[2017/05/24, 21:35:36] Stuart Mesham: Oh you gotta tell me that tomorrow
[2017/05/24, 21:35:44] Luc Hayward: Simple
[2017/05/24, 21:35:51] Luc Hayward: You had already suggested it
[2017/05/24, 21:36:19] Luc Hayward: Basically its probably that we aren't testing for all possible inputs correctly.
[2017/05/24, 21:36:50] Stuart Mesham: Like end of files?
[2017/05/24, 21:37:00] Luc Hayward: So we need to get input by using sys.stdin()
[2017/05/24, 21:37:09] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/24, 21:37:26] Luc Hayward: So like import sys
For line in sys.stdin
[2017/05/24, 21:37:49] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah
[2017/05/24, 21:42:25] Luc Hayward: But I wasnt doing that because I was pretty certain the docs say the print and input are the standard system output input respectively
[2017/05/24, 21:42:43] Stuart Mesham: Quick! Vote yes for Adam's poll to move the class test!
[2017/05/24, 21:42:56] Luc Hayward: Link
[2017/05/24, 21:43:14] Luc Hayward: Vula?
[2017/05/24, 21:43:21] Stuart Mesham: You'll need a laptop I think
[2017/05/24, 21:43:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah a Vula thing
[2017/05/24, 21:44:27] Stuart Mesham: *vote no!
[2017/05/24, 21:44:29] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/05/24, 21:44:30] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/05/24, 21:44:31] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/05/24, 21:44:33] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/05/24, 21:44:36] Luc Hayward: I know
[2017/05/24, 21:44:38] Luc Hayward: I saw
[2017/05/24, 21:44:41] Luc Hayward: Almost voted yes
[2017/05/24, 21:44:47] Luc Hayward: Stupid poll
[2017/05/24, 21:44:49] Stuart Mesham: Just making sure because I did too 😂
[2017/05/24, 21:45:07] Luc Hayward: My IT teacher would rage his jiggly tits at the poll
[2017/05/24, 21:45:14] Stuart Mesham: I could swear he did that on purpose 😄
[2017/05/24, 21:46:48] Luc Hayward: He detested any sort of multiple choice/quick answer type of question where they said things like "which would not be good/which is not the correct way etc " where they were trying to trick you. He felt questions should read "which is the bad way/what is incorrect" so that skim readers didn't fuck up
[2017/05/24, 21:47:21] Stuart Mesham: True true
[2017/05/25, 10:03:52] Luc Hayward: Meet outside comp sci same as always
[2017/05/25, 10:43:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/25, 10:44:20] Stuart Mesham: Where come 'ere you
[2017/05/25, 10:44:35] Stuart Mesham: *~where~
[2017/05/25, 16:54:54] Stuart Mesham: How do you print to 2 decimal places always?
[2017/05/25, 18:16:56] Luc Hayward: "{:.2f}".Format(somefloat)
[2017/05/25, 18:44:26] Luc Hayward: mate
[2017/05/25, 18:44:36] Luc Hayward: the literal fuck am i meant to have in my discussion for this chemistry prac
[2017/05/25, 18:45:07] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/05/25, 18:45:20] Stuart Mesham: Check the rubric it's 1 mark I think
[2017/05/25, 18:45:36] Luc Hayward: Yeah? Oh ok sweet
[2017/05/25, 19:16:05] Luc Hayward: What did you reference
[2017/05/25, 19:18:34] Stuart Mesham: Just the prac manual and the textbook
[2017/05/25, 19:18:47] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/05/26, 09:03:53] Luc Hayward: Hey
[2017/05/26, 09:04:08] Luc Hayward: Do you have a searchable PDF of essential organic chemistry
[2017/05/26, 09:04:13] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/26, 09:04:25] Luc Hayward: Not silberburg hey?
[2017/05/26, 09:04:25] Stuart Mesham: I think I airdropped it to you with the othera
[2017/05/26, 09:04:36] Stuart Mesham: No it's a separate textbook
[2017/05/26, 09:04:45] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/26, 09:04:46] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/05/26, 09:04:48] Luc Hayward: Dno
[2017/05/26, 09:04:50] Stuart Mesham: For some reason it only opens in safari though
[2017/05/26, 09:04:54] Luc Hayward: We can check today
[2017/05/26, 09:04:59] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/26, 09:05:41] Luc Hayward: Do you want to meet in comp sci?
[2017/05/26, 09:05:49] Luc Hayward: Or shall we meet in the engineering library
[2017/05/26, 09:06:25] Stuart Mesham: I think comp sci so we can talk
[2017/05/26, 09:07:32] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/05/26, 09:07:45] Luc Hayward: Will take me a solid 10 minutes to get there
[2017/05/26, 09:09:29] Stuart Mesham: Chilled you have to get to bio anyway 😄
[2017/05/26, 09:19:20] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/26, 09:19:24] Luc Hayward: We're fucked
[2017/05/26, 09:22:22] Stuart Mesham: 100%
[2017/05/26, 09:22:41] Stuart Mesham: I was too shy to put my hand up and say I don't like his subject 😄
[2017/05/26, 09:24:01] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/26, 09:25:55] Stuart Mesham: That's hella creepy 😂

[2017/05/26, 12:33:09] Luc Hayward: Qwerty is the password for both. No caps. If that doesn't work use qwert
[2017/05/26, 13:36:59] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/05/27, 10:32:50] Luc Hayward: You never came to Kenny
[2017/05/27, 10:32:53] Luc Hayward: Also
[2017/05/27, 10:32:54] Luc Hayward: Fuck
[2017/05/27, 10:33:01] Luc Hayward: Chemistry is in 4 days
[2017/05/27, 10:33:09] Luc Hayward: And then we have 4 tests the next week
[2017/05/27, 11:41:20] Stuart Mesham: Ah no I didn't
[2017/05/27, 11:42:01] Stuart Mesham: 😬🔫
[2017/05/27, 11:47:05] Stuart Mesham: Please tell me the test is not on organic fuckery?
[2017/05/27, 12:03:17] Luc Hayward: No clue
[2017/05/27, 12:21:47] Luc Hayward: Check the email and tell me?
[2017/05/27, 15:56:11] Stuart Mesham: Just the "introduction to organic chemistry" for 5 marks
[2017/05/27, 15:56:20] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/05/27, 15:56:21] Luc Hayward: So
[2017/05/27, 15:56:26] Luc Hayward: I finished 2048
[2017/05/27, 15:56:50] Stuart Mesham: Awesome
[2017/05/27, 15:57:02] Stuart Mesham: I got the up button to work 😂
[2017/05/27, 15:57:33] Stuart Mesham: Procrastinating organic chemistry hey? 😄
[2017/05/27, 15:58:12] Stuart Mesham: You gotta show me your code on Monday
[2017/05/27, 15:59:01] Stuart Mesham: My procrastination was to start making a thing to make Jurie's notes searchable 😄
[2017/05/27, 15:59:29] Stuart Mesham: It's quite a retarded idea but it was mostly for learning JavaFX more
[2017/05/27, 15:59:47] Luc Hayward: It took so long because the testing program (like you said) does the grid weirdly
[2017/05/27, 15:59:50] Luc Hayward: How?
[2017/05/27, 16:00:11] Luc Hayward: His notes would need to be run through an character recognition thing first?
[2017/05/27, 16:00:22] Luc Hayward: I'll just share it with you now
[2017/05/27, 16:00:26] Stuart Mesham: No it's not that fancy
[2017/05/27, 16:00:38] Luc Hayward: But searching??
[2017/05/27, 16:01:01] Luc Hayward: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8uMx2tv05SbN0R4ai1fMG5WVWM
[2017/05/27, 16:01:58] Stuart Mesham: You make type little descriptions of concepts as you read his notes (like "the derivative of the inverse of a function") and what page of what lecture it is
[2017/05/27, 16:02:08] Stuart Mesham: And it puts those into a database
[2017/05/27, 16:02:41] Stuart Mesham: And then there's a search bar that you can search keywords with
[2017/05/27, 16:03:21] Stuart Mesham: And when you click on a search result it loads Jurie's notes on the page of that search result
[2017/05/27, 16:04:16] Stuart Mesham: Thanks, I'm not gonna check now though because I need to make myself work again 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/05/27, 16:10:20] Luc Hayward: Oh nice
[2017/05/27, 16:10:35] Luc Hayward: Yeah im so stressed about work I don't have time to have that together
[2017/05/28, 07:50:52] Luc Hayward: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arcadecoin/get-to-the-orange-door
[2017/05/28, 09:43:35] Stuart Mesham: I don't know why, but that look like such a jol
[2017/05/28, 09:43:51] Stuart Mesham: I guess it looks vaguely similar to ratchet and clank
[2017/05/28, 09:44:16] Stuart Mesham: 3D platforming + blowing stuff up 😂
[2017/05/28, 09:44:32] Stuart Mesham: I really want to try that game
[2017/05/28, 09:44:43] Luc Hayward: There's is a demo
[2017/05/28, 09:45:21] Stuart Mesham: I know, but if I download it then procrastination will reach new heights 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/05/28, 09:49:12] Luc Hayward: Do it
[2017/05/28, 09:49:26] Luc Hayward: <‎GIF omitted>
[2017/05/28, 09:49:57] Stuart Mesham: The voice of the dark side? 😄
[2017/05/28, 09:50:36] Luc Hayward: <‎GIF omitted>
[2017/05/28, 09:51:13] Stuart Mesham: Yesterday I downloaded and tried ultimate epic battle simulator only to find out the beast doesn't have what it takes
[2017/05/28, 09:51:23] Luc Hayward: Yeah it's heavy
[2017/05/28, 09:51:29] Stuart Mesham: It ran at like 20fps
[2017/05/28, 09:51:42] Luc Hayward: Yeah the game is hell on the cpu
[2017/05/28, 09:51:51] Luc Hayward: Because it's all physics based?
[2017/05/28, 09:52:04] Luc Hayward: So like all the movement is based on physics
[2017/05/28, 09:52:29] Stuart Mesham: Yeah they weren't going for high performance there, they were just like "let's simulate _everything_!!"
[2017/05/28, 09:52:37] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/05/28, 09:53:08] Luc Hayward: It's really cool though because it means that you can do things really fast. There's no need to animate a walk cycle or anything you just physics it
[2017/05/28, 09:53:25] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that is pretty cool
[2017/05/28, 10:22:55] Stuart Mesham: Aw you need steam
[2017/05/28, 10:23:18] Stuart Mesham: His "mediafire link" seems to be non-existant
[2017/05/28, 10:42:06] Luc Hayward: Dno
[2017/05/28, 14:58:24] Luc Hayward: Ugh
[2017/05/28, 14:58:25] Luc Hayward: Calculus
[2017/05/28, 14:58:27] Luc Hayward: Whore
[2017/05/28, 15:03:42] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/28, 16:47:44] Stuart Mesham: 1/(f'(10))
[2017/05/28, 16:48:35] Stuart Mesham: And remember to do chain rule for the tan
[2017/05/28, 16:49:26] Luc Hayward: Yeah nic explained
[2017/05/28, 16:49:34] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/05/28, 16:51:22] Luc Hayward: Thanks
[2017/05/28, 16:57:09] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/05/28, 16:57:45] Luc Hayward: God awful question
[2017/05/28, 17:22:58] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/28, 17:24:04] Stuart Mesham: Which is more electronegative?
H-CH₃ or Cl-CH₃
[2017/05/28, 17:24:17] Luc Hayward: I said cl
[2017/05/28, 17:24:36] Stuart Mesham: How did you work it out?
[2017/05/28, 17:25:14] Stuart Mesham: What's the electronegativity of CH₃?
[2017/05/28, 17:25:34] Luc Hayward: No idea
[2017/05/28, 17:25:50] Luc Hayward: I took the electronegativity of carbon
[2017/05/28, 17:25:55] Luc Hayward: Cus it's bonding to the carbon
[2017/05/28, 17:26:00] Luc Hayward: But I know that's not right
[2017/05/28, 17:26:06] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/05/28, 17:26:14] Luc Hayward: Because it ignores the hydrogen bond dipoles
[2017/05/28, 17:26:16] Stuart Mesham: I wonder if he'll give us the answers
[2017/05/28, 17:26:49] Luc Hayward: He should
[2017/05/28, 17:26:57] Stuart Mesham: I hope
[2017/05/28, 17:30:41] Stuart Mesham: You were right
[2017/05/28, 17:31:01] Stuart Mesham: It was one of the questions in the textbook and they give the answers
[2017/05/28, 18:07:41] Stuart Mesham: Do you know if there's some sort of chemistry hot seat type thing that we can go to?
[2017/05/28, 18:08:00] Luc Hayward: So was I right ?
[2017/05/28, 18:08:03] Luc Hayward: Show me tomorrow
[2017/05/28, 18:08:07] Luc Hayward: And no I don't think so
[2017/05/28, 18:08:07] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/28, 18:08:09] Luc Hayward: Why?
[2017/05/28, 18:08:15] Stuart Mesham: Ag nee
[2017/05/28, 18:08:50] Stuart Mesham: As today has gone by I've understood chemistry less and less 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/05/28, 18:09:47] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/28, 18:10:49] Luc Hayward: Sooo rotation isn't resonancs. But you aren't necessarily rotating. Imagine that as a shifting of electrons
[2017/05/28, 18:11:40] Stuart Mesham: But then in what situation would it be considered a rotation and not electrons shifting?
[2017/05/28, 18:12:33] Luc Hayward: When you have say a central atom and then the outer atoms are different
[2017/05/28, 18:13:33] Stuart Mesham: Oh I think I get that now
[2017/05/28, 18:14:09] Luc Hayward: Or like imagine a linear molecule. It would be rotated if you turn it on its side
[2017/05/28, 18:15:14] Stuart Mesham: But let's say you had O=O-O and O-O=O, am I right that those are resonance?
[2017/05/28, 18:15:31] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/05/28, 18:15:41] Luc Hayward: But only 2 resonance forms
[2017/05/28, 18:16:15] Stuart Mesham: Can a linear molecule have more than 2?
[2017/05/28, 18:16:31] Stuart Mesham: A 3 atom linear molecule
[2017/05/28, 18:16:54] Luc Hayward: Hmmm
[2017/05/28, 18:16:55] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/05/28, 18:17:02] Luc Hayward: Wait
[2017/05/28, 18:17:04] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/05/28, 18:17:07] Luc Hayward: Maybe
[2017/05/28, 18:17:16] Stuart Mesham: If it's a triangle
[2017/05/28, 18:17:22] Luc Hayward: If you had a triple boobs and a double bond
[2017/05/28, 18:17:38] Luc Hayward: No it's all too so with the electron bonding
[2017/05/28, 18:17:48] Luc Hayward: Triple boobs 😂😂😂
[2017/05/28, 18:17:53] Luc Hayward: A triple bond
[2017/05/28, 18:17:58] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/05/28, 18:18:14] Luc Hayward: Then maybe you could have three
[2017/05/28, 18:18:22] Stuart Mesham: I thought that was gonna be a weird analogy 😂
[2017/05/28, 18:19:40] Stuart Mesham: So if you had triple bonds you could have (numbers being the number of bonds) O3O1O, O2O2O, O1O3O?
[2017/05/28, 18:52:01] Luc Hayward: Yeah I think so
[2017/05/28, 19:18:16] Stuart Mesham: Another question, when you're working out the Lewis Structure of NO₃ why isn't one of the oxygen atoms the central atom (Aren't you meant to put the most electronegative atom as the centre)?
[2017/05/28, 19:24:08] Luc Hayward: Yes.....
[2017/05/28, 19:24:16] Luc Hayward: But that would be weird
[2017/05/28, 19:24:29] Luc Hayward: Common sense says don't
[2017/05/28, 23:16:39] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks
[2017/05/30, 08:05:18] Stuart Mesham: No more early morning maths? 😄
[2017/05/30, 08:12:52] Luc Hayward: I'm here
[2017/05/30, 08:12:59] Luc Hayward: With Gabi
[2017/05/30, 08:13:08] Luc Hayward: Range place we usual water you
[2017/05/30, 08:13:25] Luc Hayward: Same place as usual where are you**
[2017/05/30, 08:13:39] Stuart Mesham: I thought you'd abandoned Jurie for the other guy
[2017/05/30, 08:14:00] Luc Hayward: I still come in at the same time though
[2017/05/30, 08:19:58] Luc Hayward: Where are you this morning
[2017/05/30, 10:50:41] Stuart Mesham: Come upstairs in the library?
[2017/05/30, 10:57:19] Luc Hayward: In in comp sci
[2017/05/30, 11:00:46] Stuart Mesham: Dammit I need you to explain how to do the tutorial to me 😂
[2017/05/30, 11:01:11] Luc Hayward: I told you to come here
[2017/05/30, 11:04:18] Stuart Mesham: I can't do it in comp sci
[2017/05/30, 11:04:29] Stuart Mesham: Too hard to concentrate
[2017/05/30, 11:09:35] Luc Hayward: K
[2017/05/30, 18:05:53] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/30, 18:21:49] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/05/30, 18:22:00] Luc Hayward: Not significant
[2017/05/30, 18:57:19] Luc Hayward: Hey man
[2017/05/30, 18:57:30] Luc Hayward: You're going in tomorrow yeah?
[2017/05/30, 19:15:47] Stuart Mesham: Like to maths?
[2017/05/30, 19:16:09] Stuart Mesham: I dunno hey, I'm a bit worried about this chem
[2017/05/30, 19:16:34] Stuart Mesham: And Nadia hasn't replied to me about the tutorial
[2017/05/30, 19:25:47] Stuart Mesham: Check Greg's email, they're not giving us a single formula
[2017/05/30, 19:26:07] Stuart Mesham: Only constants and a periodic table
[2017/05/30, 19:53:23] Luc Hayward: We don't need formulae this time
[2017/05/30, 19:53:29] Luc Hayward: No to chemistry
[2017/05/30, 19:53:32] Luc Hayward: I'm pretty sick
[2017/05/30, 19:53:47] Luc Hayward: Would you be able to quickly explain what he does in chem to me at like 5?
[2017/05/30, 20:05:58] Stuart Mesham: Sure, if _I_ actually understand it 👌🏻
[2017/05/30, 20:06:20] Stuart Mesham: Doesn't look to bad though from what it looks like in the notes
[2017/05/30, 20:06:25] Stuart Mesham: *too
[2017/05/30, 20:07:33] Stuart Mesham: We need to work out the work functions and electron state energies and stuff 😬
[2017/05/30, 20:07:39] Stuart Mesham: Like in tut 4
[2017/05/30, 20:53:25] Luc Hayward: Hmmm
[2017/05/30, 20:53:31] Luc Hayward: Work functions aren't ever given
[2017/05/30, 20:58:10] Stuart Mesham: Can I hangouts call you quick?
[2017/05/30, 21:00:18] Luc Hayward: Not with wi-fi
[2017/05/30, 21:00:39] Stuart Mesham: Damn
[2017/05/30, 21:00:58] Stuart Mesham: I was gonna ask how to work out valence electrons
[2017/05/30, 21:02:13] Stuart Mesham: Am I right that when you're writing valence electrons and you include the d block, the orbital number for the d block is always one less than the s block?
[2017/05/30, 21:02:16] Luc Hayward: Calendar electrons is just the period number
[2017/05/30, 21:02:33] Luc Hayward: Valwnce
[2017/05/30, 21:02:38] Luc Hayward: Wait oh
[2017/05/30, 21:02:42] Luc Hayward: You mean that section
[2017/05/30, 21:02:54] Stuart Mesham: No for writing 1s2 2p3 etc.
[2017/05/30, 21:03:08] Luc Hayward: Yeah so like number of s orbitals is the period
[2017/05/30, 21:03:12] Luc Hayward: Like the row
[2017/05/30, 21:03:29] Luc Hayward: The p orbitals are from like p2
[2017/05/30, 21:03:36] Stuart Mesham: And d is one less?
[2017/05/30, 21:03:40] Luc Hayward: Then yeah d block one less
[2017/05/30, 21:04:03] Stuart Mesham: For example Cu is 4s1 3d10
[2017/05/30, 21:04:11] Luc Hayward: Yeah think so
[2017/05/30, 21:04:32] Stuart Mesham: But then is the p block sometimes less than the s block?
[2017/05/30, 21:05:32] Luc Hayward: Yeah it can be
[2017/05/30, 21:05:51] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait I think I got it
[2017/05/30, 21:05:59] Luc Hayward: So at the end of those lectures check the video he explains it. But also remember the pattern
[2017/05/30, 21:06:13] Stuart Mesham: Let me say what I think it is then tell me if it's wrong
[2017/05/30, 21:06:41] Stuart Mesham: First you look what period it's in
[2017/05/30, 21:07:44] Stuart Mesham: Let's say it's period number x
[2017/05/30, 21:08:01] Stuart Mesham: Then you draw that squiggly thing
[2017/05/30, 21:08:12] Luc Hayward: Do you need to?
[2017/05/30, 21:08:37] Stuart Mesham: And start at xs and go down the diagonal line until you run out of valence electrons
[2017/05/30, 21:09:17] Stuart Mesham: Cancel this last step, that's wrong
[2017/05/30, 21:09:41] Stuart Mesham: *start at xs and follow the squiggly line until you run out of electrons
[2017/05/30, 21:14:11] Luc Hayward: Yeah that works
[2017/05/30, 21:16:57] Stuart Mesham: Dammit it didn't work
[2017/05/30, 21:18:37] Stuart Mesham: For Bi it's period 6 and if you start at 6s on the squiggly line you get some horrendous thing but the answer is supposed to be 6s2 6p3
[2017/05/30, 21:24:17] Luc Hayward: Hmmm
[2017/05/30, 21:36:01] Stuart Mesham: HAHAAA YESSS EUREKA!!! I FOUND IT!!!!!
[2017/05/30, 21:36:45] Stuart Mesham: 22 minutes into lecture 26
[2017/05/30, 21:37:17] Luc Hayward: Explain I'll read in the am
[2017/05/30, 21:38:09] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/05/30, 21:58:42] Stuart Mesham: Actually I'll have to show you tomorrow it's a bit hard to explain without pointing at stuff
[2017/05/31, 12:00:32] Luc Hayward: Get me today's bio handout v
[2017/05/31, 12:00:34] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/05/31, 12:55:08] Stuart Mesham: Got it 👍🏻
[2017/05/31, 12:55:15] Stuart Mesham: What time are you coming?
[2017/05/31, 12:56:15] Luc Hayward: I'll be in for my bio prac at 2
[2017/05/31, 12:58:29] Luc Hayward: Then meet you after that in the library?
[2017/05/31, 13:05:29] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/31, 13:05:44] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/05/31, 13:05:55] Luc Hayward: Did you figure chem out?
[2017/05/31, 13:06:24] Stuart Mesham: A large portion of it 👌🏻
[2017/05/31, 13:06:31] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/05/31, 13:06:34] Luc Hayward: Can teach new
[2017/05/31, 13:06:36] Luc Hayward: Me
[2017/05/31, 13:06:40] Luc Hayward: And bio today?
[2017/05/31, 13:06:45] Stuart Mesham: But I've got the valence electrons sorted
[2017/05/31, 13:07:24] Stuart Mesham: You'll just have to read the textbook for bio, there isn't that much written on the notes
[2017/05/31, 13:31:54] Luc Hayward: Feck
[2017/05/31, 13:32:18] Luc Hayward: Ok so explain this churn stuff that you confused with
[2017/05/31, 13:32:23] Luc Hayward: Chem
[2017/05/31, 13:33:18] Stuart Mesham: I'll have to show you
[2017/05/31, 13:33:33] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/05/31, 13:33:43] Stuart Mesham: Watch the part of the lecture video I sent you if you want an introduction 😄
[2017/05/31, 13:34:02] Luc Hayward: Well keep your phone on later so I can find you after the practical
[2017/05/31, 13:34:28] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/05/31, 13:53:05] Luc Hayward: Did you go back to res?
[2017/05/31, 13:54:16] Luc Hayward: If you did and haven't left please bring some a jearsey. Otherwise it's chilled
[2017/05/31, 15:03:13] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I just went back
[2017/05/31, 15:03:15] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/05/31, 15:03:49] Stuart Mesham: Tell me like 15 - 20 minutes before you finish so I can get to library at the same time as you
[2017/05/31, 15:09:51] Stuart Mesham: quick! sign up for comp sci 6pm it's almost full!
[2017/05/31, 15:09:53] Stuart Mesham: ping
[2017/05/31, 15:09:55] Stuart Mesham: ping
[2017/05/31, 15:09:57] Stuart Mesham: ping
[2017/05/31, 15:10:32] Stuart Mesham: It's on a thursday
[2017/05/31, 15:10:44] Luc Hayward: There are 300 places open
[2017/05/31, 15:10:50] Stuart Mesham: 20
[2017/05/31, 15:11:06] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/05/31, 15:11:10] Stuart Mesham: only 20 open
[2017/05/31, 15:11:20] Luc Hayward: That's says 300
[2017/05/31, 15:11:26] Stuart Mesham: oh stupid me
[2017/05/31, 15:11:39] Stuart Mesham: I looked at ct2 😂
[2017/05/31, 15:11:44] Stuart Mesham: sorry
[2017/05/31, 15:13:43] Luc Hayward: Gg
[2017/05/31, 15:13:47] Luc Hayward: Still signed up
[2017/05/31, 16:25:17] Luc Hayward: Nearly finished here
[2017/05/31, 16:26:05] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'll head for the tables up top in the library
[2017/05/31, 16:26:14] Stuart Mesham: So the usual spot
[2017/05/31, 16:43:04] Luc Hayward: Wait
[2017/05/31, 16:43:07] Luc Hayward: I need food
[2017/05/31, 16:43:33] Luc Hayward: I just finished
[2017/05/31, 16:43:38] Luc Hayward: Where you at
[2017/05/31, 19:11:15] Stuart Mesham: You aren't perhaps still here, are you?
[2017/05/31, 19:30:57] Stuart Mesham: That was so chilled
[2017/05/31, 19:40:43] Luc Hayward: So so chilled
[2017/05/31, 19:40:53] Luc Hayward: I knew for sure maybe 65%
[2017/05/31, 19:41:01] Luc Hayward: And only full on guessed one
[2017/05/31, 20:06:41] Stuart Mesham: Sorry, forgot to give you today's bio handout
[2017/05/31, 20:07:42] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I even had lots of time left over at the end to check stuff
[2017/05/31, 20:07:49] Stuart Mesham: Which is new
[2017/05/31, 20:22:30] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/05/31, 20:22:33] Luc Hayward: Tomorrow
[2017/05/31, 20:28:14] Stuart Mesham: That's an interesting name for a barber shop

[2017/05/31, 20:39:32] Stuart Mesham: Aaaah it's so trippy 😂
[2017/05/31, 20:40:18] Stuart Mesham: It took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure out how it worked 🙈
[2017/05/31, 20:40:26] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/05/31, 20:41:15] Stuart Mesham: Like where the new triangles kept coming from
[2017/05/31, 20:41:21] Stuart Mesham: It's been a long day 😂
[2017/05/31, 20:45:26] Luc Hayward: Right yeah yeah.
[2017/05/31, 21:12:54] Stuart Mesham: So apparently Google added official support for this language called Kotlin on Android Studio
[2017/05/31, 21:13:04] Luc Hayward: No idea
[2017/06/01, 13:10:39] Stuart Mesham: Yaaaay Terry said they're probably gonna move the bio test
[2017/06/01, 13:39:26] Luc Hayward: Spoke to him myself
[2017/06/01, 14:19:33] Stuart Mesham: Well done, you persuaded him 👏🏻
[2017/06/01, 15:28:53] Luc Hayward: 😂 not me
[2017/06/01, 17:54:20] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>

[2017/06/01, 21:34:57] Stuart Mesham: Done 👍🏻
[2017/06/01, 21:34:58] Stuart Mesham: Please make our comp sci test 18:00 to 18:40
[2017/06/01, 21:35:17] Luc Hayward: I chose that one
[2017/06/01, 21:35:18] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/06/01, 21:36:06] Luc Hayward: Weird I'll have to change it on the laptop
[2017/06/01, 21:36:15] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/06/02, 08:26:10] Luc Hayward: oi

[2017/06/02, 09:54:21] Stuart Mesham: I answered my phone
[2017/06/02, 09:54:21] Luc Hayward: Hi
[2017/06/02, 09:54:34] Stuart Mesham: Was that all?
[2017/06/02, 09:55:04] Luc Hayward: Well I figured it out already
[2017/06/02, 10:55:01] Stuart Mesham: I'm not sure that there's actually comp sci
[2017/06/02, 10:55:13] Stuart Mesham: The lecture hall is pretty empty
[2017/06/02, 10:58:38] Stuart Mesham: Ok so no comp sci
[2017/06/02, 10:59:23] Stuart Mesham: Meet you in the comp sci lecture hall?
[2017/06/02, 11:03:56] Luc Hayward: No I’m in not
[2017/06/02, 11:04:01] Luc Hayward: nlt
[2017/06/02, 11:08:21] Stuart Mesham: I'm not walking there 😂
[2017/06/02, 11:08:32] Stuart Mesham: See you in bio, then
[2017/06/02, 16:56:11] Stuart Mesham: The comp sci class test still says 19:00-20:00 on my calendar
[2017/06/02, 16:56:31] Luc Hayward: What should it say
[2017/06/02, 16:57:52] Stuart Mesham: 18:00-19:00
[2017/06/02, 16:58:08] Stuart Mesham: Thanks, it just came through
[2017/06/02, 16:58:33] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/06/03, 09:40:22] Stuart Mesham: Has your bio pray report been marked?
[2017/06/03, 10:01:44] Luc Hayward: No idea
[2017/06/03, 14:59:48] Stuart Mesham: I think I might actually go to the maths workshop on Monday evening
[2017/06/03, 14:59:59] Luc Hayward: what maths workshop on monday evening
[2017/06/03, 15:00:01] Luc Hayward: also
[2017/06/03, 15:00:11] Luc Hayward: chem tut is still a thing this week hey?
[2017/06/03, 15:00:15] Luc Hayward: its long this time
[2017/06/03, 15:00:16] Stuart Mesham: They just sent an e-mail
[2017/06/03, 15:00:18] Luc Hayward: like 3 pages
[2017/06/03, 15:00:21] Luc Hayward: 7 questions
[2017/06/03, 15:00:26] Stuart Mesham: Oh no
[2017/06/03, 15:00:31] Stuart Mesham: Thanks for the heads up
[2017/06/03, 15:00:40] Luc Hayward: ive been at it for a while now
[2017/06/03, 15:00:53] Luc Hayward: it's kind of a shit one because most of it is stuff we never covered yet
[2017/06/03, 15:00:58] Stuart Mesham: You been doing that today?
[2017/06/03, 15:01:15] Luc Hayward: like alkenes with multiple double bonds
[2017/06/03, 15:01:26] Luc Hayward: cis trans (or E Z) isomers
[2017/06/03, 15:01:38] Stuart Mesham: EZ 😂
[2017/06/03, 15:01:48] Luc Hayward: yeah xD
[2017/06/03, 15:01:58] Stuart Mesham: What a lie
[2017/06/03, 15:02:02] Stuart Mesham: Hectic stuff
[2017/06/03, 15:02:07] Luc Hayward: zusammen and eggaten i think
[2017/06/03, 15:02:20] Luc Hayward: etgegen sorry
[2017/06/03, 15:02:21] Stuart Mesham: What?
[2017/06/03, 15:02:33] Luc Hayward: sorry
[2017/06/03, 15:02:36] Luc Hayward: entgegen
[2017/06/03, 15:02:44] Luc Hayward: thats what the E and the Z stand for
[2017/06/03, 15:02:50] Luc Hayward: Entgegen and Zusammen
[2017/06/03, 15:02:33] Stuart Mesham: Never heard of those
[2017/06/03, 15:03:21] Luc Hayward: they just mean E = trans and cis = Z
[2017/06/03, 15:03:36] Stuart Mesham: Oh thanks
[2017/06/03, 15:04:07] Luc Hayward: we still dont have a time for bio enxt week
[2017/06/03, 15:04:22] Stuart Mesham: I'm getting worried about whether I need to start panicking about bio or not
[2017/06/03, 15:04:35] Stuart Mesham: I wish they'd just tell us now
[2017/06/03, 15:04:47] Luc Hayward: I'm panicking because we still have pracs and tuts that we HAVE to do still
[2017/06/03, 15:04:50] Luc Hayward: like this chem one
[2017/06/03, 15:04:56] Luc Hayward: and we have a chem prac and a bio prac
[2017/06/03, 15:05:04] Luc Hayward: and the bio prac has a whole big lab report too
[2017/06/03, 15:05:27] Stuart Mesham: That's surely for next week
[2017/06/03, 15:05:32] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/06/03, 15:05:34] Luc Hayward: this week
[2017/06/03, 15:05:41] Luc Hayward: wait ill look
[2017/06/03, 15:05:43] Stuart Mesham: They can't realistically expect us to do that
[2017/06/03, 15:06:09] Luc Hayward: i [resume tut is for this week nothing says otherwise for chemistry
[2017/06/03, 15:06:28] Stuart Mesham: If the bio theory test is this week then we're all failing something
[2017/06/03, 15:06:41] Stuart Mesham: Or just missing deadlines
[2017/06/03, 15:07:24] Stuart Mesham: I don't think the bio report will be due this week
[2017/06/03, 15:08:22] Luc Hayward: chemistry prac 12 and 13 is this week as normal
[2017/06/03, 15:08:34] Luc Hayward: with preprac questions
[2017/06/03, 15:09:55] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/03, 15:10:48] Luc Hayward: I'll be going to maths on monday even if i just do maths tuts there
[2017/06/03, 15:11:00] Luc Hayward: what time will it be though
[2017/06/03, 15:15:15] Stuart Mesham: Didn't you get the email a few hours ago?

[2017/06/03, 15:17:37] Luc Hayward: gg me
[2017/06/03, 15:18:08] Stuart Mesham: Yeah so I'll probably go to that
[2017/06/03, 15:18:43] Stuart Mesham: Mostly because I've only half finished the last two tutorials so I've probably missed some stuff there
[2017/06/03, 15:19:56] Luc Hayward: mate
[2017/06/03, 15:20:03] Luc Hayward: im still behind you in tuts
[2017/06/03, 15:20:05] Luc Hayward: dont stress
[2017/06/03, 15:22:04] Stuart Mesham: Yeah not really stressing about maths 😄
[2017/06/03, 15:22:20] Luc Hayward: xD i am
[2017/06/03, 15:22:41] Stuart Mesham: Shame man 😄
[2017/06/03, 15:22:59] Stuart Mesham: I'll start worrying about the Chem tut so I have something to worry about 😄
[2017/06/03, 15:23:12] Stuart Mesham: And the bio pre-prac questions
[2017/06/03, 15:23:53] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/06/03, 15:23:59] Luc Hayward: Its taken me ages dont know why
[2017/06/03, 15:49:21] Luc Hayward: new comp sci assignment too
[2017/06/03, 15:49:27] Luc Hayward: can probably do it on friday
[2017/06/03, 16:53:23] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/04, 09:36:50] Stuart Mesham: Wait so what do we do for the E in (E)-3-methylhex-3-ene again?
[2017/06/04, 11:04:56] Luc Hayward: Hmm
[2017/06/04, 11:05:10] Luc Hayward: I can't reneged
[2017/06/04, 11:06:58] Stuart Mesham: Also I've been trekking through Jurie's notes to learn stuff and I've been adding notes to my Jurie's notes searcher so it might be useful if you want it?
[2017/06/04, 11:07:23] Stuart Mesham: It's got like 80% of his notes now
[2017/06/04, 11:25:36] Luc Hayward: 👍🏼👍🏼
[2017/06/04, 11:43:25] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>

[2017/06/04, 13:08:49] Luc Hayward: Mine was right
[2017/06/04, 13:09:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/04, 13:09:31] Stuart Mesham: I put it in the calendar
[2017/06/04, 13:10:02] Luc Hayward: 👍🏼👍🏼
[2017/06/04, 13:15:36] Luc Hayward: I should mention I never finished he chem tut. I left a few questions till we are taught them
[2017/06/04, 14:47:28] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/06/04, 14:47:55] Luc Hayward: Did you?
[2017/06/04, 14:48:12] Stuart Mesham: No I stopped at that question
[2017/06/04, 14:48:25] Stuart Mesham: With the E
[2017/06/04, 14:49:21] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/06/04, 15:31:09] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/04, 16:02:59] Luc Hayward: Nevermind
[2017/06/04, 16:03:00] Luc Hayward: But
[2017/06/04, 16:03:10] Luc Hayward: We have no past papers
[2017/06/04, 16:10:39] Stuart Mesham: https://quizlet.com/_3ipqp5
[2017/06/04, 16:10:47] Stuart Mesham: For?
[2017/06/04, 16:24:55] Luc Hayward: The maths test
[2017/06/04, 16:25:09] Luc Hayward: Also
[2017/06/04, 16:25:10] Luc Hayward: Thabks
[2017/06/04, 16:25:12] Luc Hayward: Also
[2017/06/04, 16:25:30] Stuart Mesham: What's wrong with last year's ones?
[2017/06/04, 16:25:36] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/04, 16:25:53] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/04, 16:26:15] Stuart Mesham: Nah it must be a mistake
[2017/06/04, 16:26:35] Luc Hayward: Oh it's this test one for maths?
[2017/06/04, 16:26:52] Luc Hayward: Ie the first test done the decant
[2017/06/04, 16:27:41] Luc Hayward: No.... Stu where did you get past papers from
[2017/06/04, 16:27:47] Stuart Mesham: Test 2 past papers are up
[2017/06/04, 16:28:10] Luc Hayward: Where?
[2017/06/04, 16:28:14] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/06/04, 16:28:16] Luc Hayward: See
[2017/06/04, 16:28:20] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/04, 16:28:22] Luc Hayward: Their own folder
[2017/06/04, 16:28:26] Luc Hayward: Not in the zip
[2017/06/04, 16:28:38] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/06/04, 17:12:13] Luc Hayward: https://pixelduke.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/jmetro-windows-8-controls-on-java/
[2017/06/04, 17:12:19] Luc Hayward: throw this onto your notes app
[2017/06/04, 17:32:23] Stuart Mesham: That looks interesting
[2017/06/04, 17:33:37] Stuart Mesham: You'll have to show me how tomorrow though because I'm gonna be a bit busy this evening and I don't know how to use css with javafx yet
[2017/06/04, 17:34:32] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/06/04, 17:35:02] Stuart Mesham: The last web assign question is rashing me
[2017/06/04, 17:35:49] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/04, 17:36:09] Luc Hayward: Is that this weeksv
[2017/06/04, 17:36:21] Stuart Mesham: Isn't it just meant to be 1 divided by this: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=derivative+of+2x%5E3%2B6tan(pi*x%2F4)+at+x+%3D+8
[2017/06/04, 17:36:37] Luc Hayward: Make x=1
[2017/06/04, 17:36:41] Stuart Mesham: So the reciprocal of the derivative of f(x)
[2017/06/04, 17:36:55] Stuart Mesham: Yeah this week
[2017/06/04, 17:37:32] Luc Hayward: Yeah o take 1/ddx at 1
[2017/06/04, 17:37:49] Stuart Mesham: Why at 1?
[2017/06/04, 17:38:10] Stuart Mesham: And not 8
[2017/06/04, 17:38:39] Luc Hayward: Because you need the inverse. And f(1)=f^-1(8)
[2017/06/04, 17:38:54] Stuart Mesham: Ohhhhhhh
[2017/06/04, 17:39:40] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/06/04, 17:40:09] Luc Hayward: Actually I think I wrote that wrong
[2017/06/04, 17:42:12] Stuart Mesham: How did you work out so quickly that it was 1?
[2017/06/04, 17:42:45] Luc Hayward: Because they're all one on webassign😂
[2017/06/04, 17:43:11] Stuart Mesham: Naas 😂
[2017/06/04, 17:46:10] Luc Hayward: But it's cus of the coefficients
[2017/06/04, 17:47:48] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/06/04, 17:47:56] Stuart Mesham: All sorted now 👌🏻
[2017/06/04, 20:48:31] Stuart Mesham: When do our exams end?
[2017/06/04, 20:48:59] Luc Hayward: 12 July
[2017/06/04, 20:49:19] Stuart Mesham: Is that a chemistry exam?

[2017/06/05, 16:51:04] Stuart Mesham: I might just go now
[2017/06/05, 16:52:32] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/06/05, 16:52:37] Luc Hayward: no idea
[2017/06/05, 16:52:42] Luc Hayward: dont think its running anymore
[2017/06/05, 18:27:58] Stuart Mesham: Yeah they didn't let me in
[2017/06/05, 18:28:18] Luc Hayward: Figured
[2017/06/05, 18:50:13] Luc Hayward: you watching wwdc
[2017/06/05, 18:50:43] Stuart Mesham: Hell no
[2017/06/05, 18:50:53] Stuart Mesham: I'm doinh my Chem pre-prac
[2017/06/05, 18:51:00] Stuart Mesham: Life is tough
[2017/06/05, 18:55:54] Luc Hayward: gonna leave the stream next to me probably
[2017/06/05, 20:36:39] Luc Hayward: motherfuck that looks pretty good (check the ar that apple is launching). really excited to try some of this stuff
[2017/06/05, 20:37:06] Luc Hayward: it looks almost as good as tango on the surface(though they were very quick to stop demoing)
[2017/06/05, 21:14:20] Stuart Mesham: Will check it out later
[2017/06/05, 21:14:29] Luc Hayward: wow i love proofs
[2017/06/05, 21:14:31] Luc Hayward: dont you?
[2017/06/05, 21:14:41] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/05, 21:14:52] Stuart Mesham: Aswell 😄
[2017/06/05, 21:15:52] Stuart Mesham: How can it have 2 CH₃s joined together at the end??
[2017/06/05, 21:16:56] Luc Hayward: ok so here is how i wrote it

[2017/06/05, 21:21:45] Luc Hayward: and the second one
[2017/06/05, 21:22:13] Stuart Mesham: Where are the CH₃s?
[2017/06/05, 21:22:27] Stuart Mesham: Also why do you have edge open? 😂
[2017/06/05, 21:23:54] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/05, 21:24:09] Luc Hayward: its the only thing that streams wwdc on windows 10
[2017/06/05, 21:24:35] Luc Hayward: ill show you again
[2017/06/05, 21:24:19] Stuart Mesham: Pls use the snip tool, printscreen gets compressed so I can't read it 🙈
[2017/06/05, 21:26:09] Luc Hayward: you only need to see the drawing?
[2017/06/05, 21:26:14] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/05, 21:26:34] Stuart Mesham: I can't see what you circled on whatsapp
[2017/06/05, 21:26:41] Luc Hayward: oh i didnt
[2017/06/05, 21:26:48] Luc Hayward: that's a different chat from someone else xD
[2017/06/05, 21:28:39] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna have to look up how to understand this notation because I don't get it at all 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/06/05, 21:30:02] Luc Hayward: i think that's what it is
[2017/06/05, 21:30:08] Luc Hayward: so basically what i did
[2017/06/05, 21:31:48] Luc Hayward: is i say ok for number one, ch3 can exist at the start. i know it's an alkane so ch2 can happen twice which is what (CH3)2 says. then CH tells me that it only has one H and needs something else, CH3 cant be in the middle so that must be bonded where the second H should go. Then 3 more CH2 molecules and a CH# molecule caps it off
[2017/06/05, 21:34:46] Stuart Mesham: Did you have to add up the numbers of C and H atoms to know it's an alkane?
[2017/06/05, 21:37:22] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait so the brackets and the order of things has nothing to do with the structure?
[2017/06/05, 21:45:56] Luc Hayward: No doesn't it tell us it's an alkane?
[2017/06/05, 21:46:09] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/06/05, 21:47:44] Stuart Mesham: Nevermind, I figured it out
[2017/06/05, 21:47:52] Luc Hayward: No tell me !
[2017/06/05, 21:48:12] Luc Hayward: I thought it told us they were alkanes
[2017/06/05, 21:48:18] Luc Hayward: If theyre alkanes it's different
[2017/06/05, 21:48:18] Stuart Mesham: Basically just wing it like division by inspection
[2017/06/05, 21:48:46] Stuart Mesham: Just go through it trying to put all the parts into one molecule
[2017/06/05, 21:49:04] Stuart Mesham: Like find a layout where they can all go into one thing
[2017/06/05, 21:49:10] Luc Hayward: I mean I think it still works best if they're alkanes like I showed you ?
[2017/06/05, 21:49:27] Stuart Mesham: Just as you go along make notes of what's left over that you still need to put onto the molecule
[2017/06/05, 21:50:59] Stuart Mesham: Yeah they both work but I have no idea how to decide whether one of these formulas is an alkene or not 😂
[2017/06/05, 21:51:07] Stuart Mesham: I'm not complaining
[2017/06/05, 21:51:26] Stuart Mesham: I answered the tut question 3, my job is done 😂
[2017/06/05, 21:51:30] Luc Hayward: Well I tried them as aliened and they don't fit
[2017/06/05, 21:51:54] Stuart Mesham: It's hard to be sure
[2017/06/05, 21:52:55] Stuart Mesham: Like for the second one when you have 3 CH₃s at the start if you start with those 2 then you can't add anything else to the molecule so you gotta keep trying stuff until it fits
[2017/06/05, 21:53:09] Stuart Mesham: *2 CH₃s
[2017/06/05, 21:54:31] Luc Hayward: What if you do what I slowed you where one of them is a branch
[2017/06/05, 21:54:48] Luc Hayward: How are you sibscripting in whatsapp
[2017/06/05, 21:54:56] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I did that
[2017/06/05, 21:55:15] Stuart Mesham: ₃ is in the clipboard
[2017/06/05, 21:55:24] Stuart Mesham: I just keep pasting 😄
[2017/06/05, 21:55:33] Luc Hayward: Ohh
[2017/06/05, 21:55:43] Luc Hayward: Did that work
[2017/06/05, 21:56:05] Stuart Mesham: http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/superscripts_and_subscripts/list.htm I just copy them from here
[2017/06/05, 21:56:18] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/05, 21:56:28] Luc Hayward: Sweet
[2017/06/05, 21:57:42] Stuart Mesham: There must be some system to the brackets though
[2017/06/05, 21:57:50] Stuart Mesham: But I can't figure it out
[2017/06/05, 21:58:20] Luc Hayward: They're just showing how many of that geo so you don't quite it excessively long
[2017/06/05, 21:58:49] Stuart Mesham: I want to say they show branching but if you look at 3.1 the CH₃ is not in brackets
[2017/06/05, 21:59:30] Luc Hayward: Nah
[2017/06/05, 21:59:39] Stuart Mesham: Oh so you think in 3.2 the brackets around the CH₃ at the start are just because there are 2 of them and not because of the branching?
[2017/06/05, 22:00:08] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/06/05, 22:00:41] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/06/05, 22:02:35] Luc Hayward: I think
[2017/06/05, 22:20:19] Stuart Mesham: Was your answer to 3.10 4-methyl-2-isopropylhex-2-ane?
[2017/06/05, 22:25:07] Luc Hayward: No clue showe me tomorrow
[2017/06/05, 22:25:39] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/06/06, 12:23:48] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/06, 13:42:20] Stuart Mesham: Luc
[2017/06/06, 13:42:21] Stuart Mesham: Luc
[2017/06/06, 13:42:24] Stuart Mesham: Luc
[2017/06/06, 13:43:33] Stuart Mesham: Read Jono's last email, put your hands up in the air and shout hallelujah! 🙌🏻
[2017/06/06, 13:51:12] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/06/06, 13:51:17] Luc Hayward: Might just pass bio
[2017/06/06, 13:51:20] Luc Hayward: Might
[2017/06/06, 14:00:11] Stuart Mesham: Yes bois yes bois
[2017/06/06, 14:00:26] Stuart Mesham: Cram it in
[2017/06/06, 14:00:44] Stuart Mesham: Or the bio test will cram something worse in
[2017/06/06, 14:01:40] Stuart Mesham: I felt really relieved now it's starting to dawn on me that the bio test by itself is still pretty bad
[2017/06/06, 14:16:07] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/06/06, 14:16:10] Luc Hayward: I've lost Keegan
[2017/06/06, 14:16:14] Luc Hayward: Here has my bag
[2017/06/06, 14:16:16] Luc Hayward: He
[2017/06/06, 15:15:56] Stuart Mesham: Eyy campus is closed tomorrow 🙌🏻
[2017/06/06, 15:16:19] Stuart Mesham: No lectures, tuts, pracs or anything
[2017/06/06, 15:16:37] Stuart Mesham: Dammit I've missed the bio tut completely then 😕
[2017/06/06, 15:18:18] Luc Hayward: Thursdays might still be open
[2017/06/06, 15:38:11] Luc Hayward: Hey
[2017/06/06, 15:38:16] Luc Hayward: I just met you
[2017/06/06, 15:38:28] Luc Hayward: This is crazy
[2017/06/06, 15:38:34] Luc Hayward: Here's my number
[2017/06/06, 15:38:36] Luc Hayward: Call me
[2017/06/06, 15:38:38] Luc Hayward: Later
[2017/06/06, 16:56:49] Stuart Mesham: Wut
[2017/06/06, 16:57:07] Luc Hayward: Keegan
[2017/06/06, 16:57:15] Luc Hayward: But yeah Thursday
[2017/06/06, 16:58:04] Stuart Mesham: That's after the test though
[2017/06/06, 16:58:13] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/06/06, 16:58:19] Luc Hayward: Go to 10am
[2017/06/06, 16:58:27] Luc Hayward: Skip maths
[2017/06/06, 17:02:08] Stuart Mesham: Ey I joined the Wednesday maths tut so I get marked as not having missed it
[2017/06/06, 17:02:30] Stuart Mesham: You might want to just in case you miss it on Thursday
[2017/06/06, 17:02:42] Luc Hayward: I went today
[2017/06/06, 17:02:48] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/06/06, 17:04:05] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/06/06, 20:27:36] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/06, 20:28:28] Luc Hayward: Not a clue
[2017/06/06, 20:29:39] Stuart Mesham: Have you done the tutorial?
[2017/06/06, 20:31:12] Luc Hayward: Not finished
[2017/06/06, 20:31:22] Luc Hayward: But I don't have it in front of me
[2017/06/06, 20:31:42] Luc Hayward: 2.6 looks weird
[2017/06/06, 20:40:29] Stuart Mesham: Useless!
[2017/06/06, 20:40:47] Luc Hayward: Are you finished?
[2017/06/06, 20:41:25] Stuart Mesham: No I've got up to question 4 but most of my questions 2 and 3 are probably wrong
[2017/06/06, 20:41:52] Luc Hayward: 😂 probably not
[2017/06/06, 20:42:19] Luc Hayward: Actually 2.6 could be right
[2017/06/06, 20:45:32] Stuart Mesham: I really don't know
[2017/06/06, 20:45:55] Luc Hayward: What should it be? I don't know the questions
[2017/06/06, 20:46:08] Stuart Mesham: I even watched 2 Kahn Academy videos and I'm still not sure because these are so different to the examples in the videos
[2017/06/06, 20:46:54] Stuart Mesham: (Z)-4-ethyl-3,7-dimethyloct-3-ene
[2017/06/06, 20:47:25] Luc Hayward: I skipped that
[2017/06/06, 20:47:30] Luc Hayward: But let's see
[2017/06/06, 20:47:35] Stuart Mesham: Wise decision
[2017/06/06, 20:47:42] Stuart Mesham: And the others?
[2017/06/06, 20:47:53] Luc Hayward: No idea
[2017/06/06, 20:47:55] Stuart Mesham: 2.4 (E)-3-methylhex-3-ene
2.5 3-isopropyl-6-methylhept-1-ene
2.6 (Z)-4-ethyl-3,7-dimethyloct-3-ene
2.7 cis-1,4-hexadiene
[2017/06/06, 20:48:02] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/06/06, 20:48:24] Luc Hayward: If you type those into a calculator online it will show you
[2017/06/06, 20:48:54] Stuart Mesham: It said "no matching results"
[2017/06/06, 20:49:08] Stuart Mesham: What online calculator did you use​?
[2017/06/06, 20:49:16] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/06/06, 20:49:23] Stuart Mesham: Not chemspider?
[2017/06/06, 20:49:57] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/06/06, 20:50:12] Luc Hayward: Also2.6 is correct
[2017/06/06, 20:50:13] Stuart Mesham: Molcalc?
[2017/06/06, 20:50:29] Stuart Mesham: Oh sweet
[2017/06/06, 20:51:31] Luc Hayward: Note
[2017/06/06, 20:51:33] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/06/06, 20:52:35] Stuart Mesham: I can't see the name on those pics you sent 😂
[2017/06/06, 20:53:02] Luc Hayward: I dunno man
[2017/06/06, 20:53:57] Stuart Mesham: Can you see the name here?
[2017/06/06, 20:58:21] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/06/06, 20:58:34] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/06/06, 20:58:36] Stuart Mesham: Ok never mind
[2017/06/06, 20:58:38] Luc Hayward: Try molview
[2017/06/06, 20:58:49] Stuart Mesham: I'll try
[2017/06/07, 16:02:34] Luc Hayward: havent finished the tut still
[2017/06/07, 16:07:27] Stuart Mesham: You need to finish it fast
[2017/06/07, 16:07:49] Stuart Mesham: Cellular respiration is massive
[2017/06/07, 16:08:17] Stuart Mesham: Just guess what you don't know
[2017/06/07, 16:08:33] Stuart Mesham: Then do it in the tut session tomorrow
[2017/06/07, 16:09:48] Luc Hayward: it's enourmas and I'm resigned that I'm never going to know it in depth
[2017/06/07, 16:10:45] Luc Hayward: I'm just going to khan academy the shit out of it
[2017/06/07, 16:13:16] Stuart Mesham: You gotta start like right now
[2017/06/07, 16:13:33] Luc Hayward: I've been going almost all day./..
[2017/06/07, 16:13:35] Stuart Mesham: Even if you Kahn Academy it'll take the whole afternoon
[2017/06/07, 16:13:46] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/06/07, 16:13:51] Luc Hayward: also can i send you the multiple choice potion of the 2015 paper see if you agree with me?
[2017/06/07, 16:13:53] Stuart Mesham: Keep it up then 😄
[2017/06/07, 16:13:59] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/07, 16:14:29] Stuart Mesham: I'm only starting photosynthesis now though so I'll probably only know the cellular respiration part
[2017/06/07, 16:17:41] Luc Hayward: kk
[2017/06/07, 16:56:45] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>

[2017/06/07, 17:18:17] Luc Hayward: what you think
[2017/06/07, 17:19:24] Luc Hayward: blue is sure
[2017/06/07, 17:19:26] Luc Hayward: yellow is unsure
[2017/06/07, 17:22:46] Stuart Mesham: 😂 true that sounds way more excruciating
[2017/06/07, 17:23:17] Stuart Mesham: I'll check now
[2017/06/07, 17:23:26] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/06/07, 17:25:04] Stuart Mesham: You didn't save your answers
[2017/06/07, 17:25:13] Luc Hayward: fuck ok
[2017/06/07, 17:26:03] Luc Hayward: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8uMx2tv05Sbc3dhUnhIelM1WWc/view?usp=sharing
[2017/06/07, 17:26:19] Luc Hayward: worked on the downloaded one and put the original copy into the folder ....
[2017/06/07, 17:29:38] Stuart Mesham: I think 15 should be A
[2017/06/07, 17:31:08] Luc Hayward: should be a?
[2017/06/07, 17:31:51] Stuart Mesham: They normally talk about 2 molecules of pyruvate which become 2 molecules of citrate and produce 2 molecules of ATP etc. because they're talking about "per glucose molecule"
[2017/06/07, 17:32:13] Stuart Mesham: i.e. there will be 2 citrate molecules per glucose molecule
[2017/06/07, 17:32:19] Stuart Mesham: so 2 ATP produced
[2017/06/07, 17:32:34] Stuart Mesham: but if you only have 1 citrate then only 1 ATP is produced
[2017/06/07, 17:32:38] Luc Hayward: ah yeah you're right
[2017/06/07, 17:33:41] Stuart Mesham: WTF is question 16
[2017/06/07, 17:33:54] Luc Hayward: i dno
[2017/06/07, 17:34:13] Luc Hayward: I just chose alpha-ketoglutarate because it is a 5C molecule in the citric acid cycle
[2017/06/07, 17:34:27] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/06/07, 17:35:05] Luc Hayward: It's the only 5 carbon actually
[2017/06/07, 17:35:44] Stuart Mesham: Holy damn we have to know the number of carbons in all of those
[2017/06/07, 17:35:52] Luc Hayward: nah i dont think so
[2017/06/07, 17:36:07] Luc Hayward: if you're curios though its 5 carbon in alpha kg
[2017/06/07, 17:36:13] Luc Hayward: then 4 in everything afterr that
[2017/06/07, 17:36:25] Stuart Mesham: Just know alpha is the only one with 5?
[2017/06/07, 17:36:28] Luc Hayward: and 6 in citrate and icocitrate
[2017/06/07, 17:36:35] Luc Hayward: so citrates are 6
[2017/06/07, 17:36:40] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/06/07, 17:36:47] Stuart Mesham: Right
[2017/06/07, 17:36:58] Luc Hayward: is Malate what is used in C$ plants?
[2017/06/07, 17:37:00] Luc Hayward: c4
[2017/06/07, 17:38:47] Stuart Mesham: Dunno, haven't got to the plants section yet
[2017/06/07, 17:38:58] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/06/07, 17:39:08] Luc Hayward: I'm starting to feel the fuck this headache setting in
[2017/06/07, 17:39:20] Stuart Mesham: Malate is the last molecule in the citric acid cycle before oxaloacetate though
[2017/06/07, 17:39:31] Luc Hayward: yeah....
[2017/06/07, 17:39:38] Stuart Mesham: I think 18 should be C
[2017/06/07, 17:39:56] Stuart Mesham: Wait cancel
[2017/06/07, 17:40:34] Stuart Mesham: No not cancel
[2017/06/07, 17:40:43] Stuart Mesham: I do think 18 should be C
[2017/06/07, 17:41:00] Luc Hayward: i thought we were making NADH
[2017/06/07, 17:41:04] Stuart Mesham: Because glycolysis is NAD+ -> NADH
[2017/06/07, 17:41:42] Stuart Mesham: No fermentation makes NAD+ from NADH so glycolysis can carry on going
[2017/06/07, 17:41:47] Luc Hayward: Under anaerobic conditions,
NAD+
is regenerated by
transferring electrons from
NADH to pyruvate, a process
referred to as Fermentation
[2017/06/07, 17:41:50] Luc Hayward: you're right
[2017/06/07, 17:42:03] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/07, 17:42:11] Stuart Mesham: They're the yin and the yang
[2017/06/07, 17:42:12] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/06/07, 17:42:17] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/06/07, 17:42:18] Stuart Mesham: Glycolysis and fermentation
[2017/06/07, 17:42:25] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/06/07, 17:44:22] Stuart Mesham: For 2 (scrolling down from 18) I don't know the answer but I would've guessed D
[2017/06/07, 17:45:27] Stuart Mesham: Because electrons associated with Hydrogen have a long way to "fall down an electronegativity gradient to oxygen"
[2017/06/07, 17:50:07] Stuart Mesham: And I think 7 should be A
[2017/06/07, 17:52:07] Luc Hayward: The pigment molecules responsible for photosynthesis are located in the:??
[2017/06/07, 17:52:23] Luc Hayward: oh the secodn set you mean
[2017/06/07, 17:52:47] Luc Hayward: it should be D
[2017/06/07, 17:53:07] Luc Hayward: for 7
[2017/06/07, 17:53:51] Stuart Mesham: Not that 7
[2017/06/07, 17:53:56] Luc Hayward: but here, hydrogen only ever has one electron, i would have said long carbon chains
[2017/06/07, 17:54:06] Luc Hayward: yeah for the second 7 it should actually be d
[2017/06/07, 17:54:12] Luc Hayward: activate the enzyme and increase the rates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.
[2017/06/07, 17:54:43] Stuart Mesham: Surely deactivate+inhibit?
[2017/06/07, 17:54:48] Luc Hayward: nah
[2017/06/07, 17:55:36] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/07, 17:55:54] Luc Hayward: I took this to mean that lots of atp provided to the enzyme (pfk) will make it happen more
[2017/06/07, 17:56:07] Luc Hayward: because pfk is in the investment phase
[2017/06/07, 17:56:08] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/07, 17:56:22] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait that's -
[2017/06/07, 17:56:29] Stuart Mesham: Never mind
[2017/06/07, 17:56:50] Luc Hayward: thats so weird
[2017/06/07, 17:57:02] Luc Hayward: i dunno if the minus means not enough or it means inhibit
[2017/06/07, 17:57:10] Stuart Mesham: Wait no it is inhibit
[2017/06/07, 17:57:23] Luc Hayward: because it wouldn't make sense that it is inhibited by the same molecule it needs to functions
[2017/06/07, 17:57:53] Stuart Mesham: Because overall the processes combined produce ATP so this is allosteric regulation of the combined processes so that they don't make too much ATP
[2017/06/07, 17:58:01] Stuart Mesham: So I still think it's inhibit
[2017/06/07, 17:58:10] Luc Hayward: it is inhibit
[2017/06/07, 17:58:25] Luc Hayward: weird
[2017/06/07, 17:58:38] Stuart Mesham: Very weird
[2017/06/07, 17:58:50] Luc Hayward: oh well
[2017/06/07, 17:58:57] Luc Hayward: I think its fixed now
[2017/06/07, 17:59:08] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/07, 17:59:18] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/06/07, 17:59:22] Luc Hayward: cool
[2017/06/07, 17:59:38] Stuart Mesham: I will be so happy if they give us short answer question 3
[2017/06/07, 17:59:41] Stuart Mesham: So so happy
[2017/06/07, 17:59:47] Stuart Mesham: It's just that table
[2017/06/07, 18:00:01] Stuart Mesham: And I got that all in ma nogin
[2017/06/07, 18:00:27] Stuart Mesham: 8 marks
[2017/06/07, 18:00:29] Stuart Mesham: EZ
[2017/06/07, 18:01:00] Luc Hayward: my thinking is, maths in the morning, then chem tut, then bio tut and then skip comp sci to study bio together last minute. then bio test and finally meet at 5 to study comp sci?
[2017/06/07, 18:01:05] Luc Hayward: oh yeah
[2017/06/07, 18:01:34] Luc Hayward: 2 atp from substrate level phosphorylation in glycolysis?
[2017/06/07, 18:01:41] Stuart Mesham: I can't go to maths because I have to go do the last part of my chem prac in the morning
[2017/06/07, 18:02:05] Stuart Mesham: The chem people decided to rash us and say we had to do it and hand in our reports by 3 tomorrow
[2017/06/07, 18:02:17] Stuart Mesham: So I won't be at maths
[2017/06/07, 18:02:39] Luc Hayward: isnt it friday
[2017/06/07, 18:03:08] Luc Hayward: Because of the tests tomorrow and Thursday, students who did Experiment 8 today (Tuesday 30th May) may hand in their practical reports no later than 13h00 on Friday 2nd June.
[2017/06/07, 18:03:20] Stuart Mesham: No my prac that I did on Tuesday you have to leave something to dry then come back another day to do the last bit of the prac
[2017/06/07, 18:03:55] Stuart Mesham: Isn't that bio?
[2017/06/07, 18:04:01] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/06/07, 18:04:04] Luc Hayward: that's from eileen
[2017/06/07, 18:04:10] Stuart Mesham: When was that email?
[2017/06/07, 18:04:36] Luc Hayward: oh shit sorry
[2017/06/07, 18:04:39] Luc Hayward: that's last week
[2017/06/07, 18:04:42] Luc Hayward: awkward
[2017/06/07, 18:05:07] Stuart Mesham: False hope 😂
[2017/06/07, 18:05:47] Luc Hayward: 2x(3NADH + 1FADH + 1ATP).... is that the citric acid portion?
[2017/06/07, 18:05:47] Stuart Mesham: Anyway
[2017/06/07, 18:05:51] Stuart Mesham: Back to........
[2017/06/07, 18:06:33] Stuart Mesham: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/06/07, 18:07:30] Stuart Mesham: You know what's amazing?
[2017/06/07, 18:08:46] Stuart Mesham: Yes
[2017/06/07, 18:09:37] Stuart Mesham: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/06/07, 18:10:12] Stuart Mesham: Did you know that?
[2017/06/07, 18:10:52] Stuart Mesham: Ok then 😂
[2017/06/07, 18:11:29] Luc Hayward: are you actually listening to those
[2017/06/07, 18:11:50] Stuart Mesham: No but I did now 😄
[2017/06/07, 18:12:26] Stuart Mesham: I didn't learn anything but it was great microsleep
[2017/06/07, 18:15:48] Luc Hayward: wait.......
[2017/06/07, 18:16:01] Luc Hayward: this doesnt work
[2017/06/07, 18:16:34] Luc Hayward: they dont add up for me
[2017/06/07, 18:17:01] Luc Hayward: oh because I'm missing a step
[2017/06/07, 18:17:26] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/07, 18:17:46] Luc Hayward: was missing the 2NADH in glycolysis and the two NADH of CoA
[2017/06/07, 18:18:31] Luc Hayward: they probably will specifically not ask this one
[2017/06/07, 18:21:24] Stuart Mesham: Yeah you need glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation as well
[2017/06/07, 18:21:37] Luc Hayward: i was missing the 4 nadh
[2017/06/07, 18:22:05] Luc Hayward: where is this from which note set?>
[2017/06/07, 18:22:05] Stuart Mesham: It's 2 from glycolysis and 2 from pyruvate oxidation
[2017/06/07, 18:22:10] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/07, 18:22:16] Stuart Mesham: Textbook
[2017/06/07, 18:22:23] Luc Hayward: ah ok
[2017/06/07, 18:22:28] Luc Hayward: maybe i should haul that out too
[2017/06/07, 18:22:51] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it's quite long though
[2017/06/07, 18:23:01] Luc Hayward: nah screw it
[2017/06/07, 18:23:00] Stuart Mesham: But it's basically what I've done today
[2017/06/07, 18:23:12] Luc Hayward: you can teach me tomorrow xD
[2017/06/07, 18:23:34] Stuart Mesham: No I gotta learn photosynthesis
[2017/06/07, 18:23:51] Luc Hayward: yeah i meant i wont pull out textbook
[2017/06/07, 18:23:52] Stuart Mesham: You can actually teach me photosynthesis 😂
[2017/06/07, 18:23:57] Luc Hayward: photosynthesis i think i have down
[2017/06/07, 18:24:08] Luc Hayward: except I dont know in depth like the names of things in the ETC
[2017/06/07, 18:24:16] Luc Hayward: but i know enough to do a 6 marker i think
[2017/06/07, 18:24:22] Luc Hayward: like the flow of electrons
[2017/06/07, 18:24:49] Stuart Mesham: I trekked through a lot of the textbook section on respiration today
[2017/06/07, 18:25:04] Luc Hayward: nice
[2017/06/07, 18:25:20] Stuart Mesham: I didn't understand the lecture slides 😂
[2017/06/07, 18:25:25] Stuart Mesham: Even with googling
[2017/06/07, 18:25:28] Luc Hayward: I'm confidant i could get a 70 in this 2015 paper
[2017/06/07, 18:25:36] Luc Hayward: ok I'll take a look too
[2017/06/07, 18:25:44] Stuart Mesham: Naas 😄
[2017/06/07, 18:26:03] Stuart Mesham: It's a trek, just a warning 😂
[2017/06/07, 18:26:10] Luc Hayward: no fuck that
[2017/06/07, 18:27:06] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/06/07, 18:27:36] Luc Hayward: I'm leaving this behind after exams
[2017/06/07, 18:30:30] Luc Hayward: so like
[2017/06/07, 18:31:45] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/Cq93sHyLeiE?t=25s
[2017/06/07, 18:31:51] Luc Hayward: current feeling towards this test
[2017/06/07, 19:09:19] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/06/08, 08:29:41] Luc Hayward: Where's you at
[2017/06/08, 08:49:38] Stuart Mesham: The lab was locked so rip my Chem prac getting handed in by 1
[2017/06/08, 08:49:51] Stuart Mesham: I'm on my way to Chem now
[2017/06/08, 09:38:33] Stuart Mesham: I'm going straight to Sam after this
[2017/06/08, 15:25:54] Stuart Mesham: Dammit Dawood
[2017/06/08, 15:27:44] Luc Hayward: ??
[2017/06/08, 15:28:03] Stuart Mesham: He moved our prac test to 12 am
[2017/06/08, 15:28:09] Stuart Mesham: Tomorrow
[2017/06/08, 15:28:20] Luc Hayward: Fuck yes
[2017/06/08, 15:28:24] Luc Hayward: Wait
[2017/06/08, 15:28:41] Stuart Mesham: Now we have min time to study
[2017/06/08, 15:29:26] Luc Hayward: Eh that's fine
[2017/06/08, 15:29:40] Luc Hayward: Will you alter the calendar ? We will both be in the lecture hall
[2017/06/08, 15:29:49] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/08, 15:30:04] Luc Hayward: Thanks
[2017/06/08, 15:30:08] Luc Hayward: That's a kak one
[2017/06/08, 16:05:45] Stuart Mesham: Note to self: when answering comp sci, never say "the iterative version is easier to understand" even if it is. It'll trigger Michelle 😂
[2017/06/08, 16:28:59] Luc Hayward: 😂 really?
[2017/06/08, 16:32:28] Luc Hayward: Come study with us in the code place best the library
[2017/06/08, 16:44:07] Stuart Mesham: Code place?
[2017/06/08, 16:44:17] Stuart Mesham: Upstairs?
[2017/06/08, 17:05:45] Luc Hayward: woops
[2017/06/08, 17:05:50] Luc Hayward: meant coffee
[2017/06/08, 17:05:56] Luc Hayward: but yeah that's where we are now
[2017/06/08, 17:06:01] Luc Hayward: upstairs by the talking area\
[2017/06/08, 17:06:32] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'll see you for the test. I'll just finish studying here
[2017/06/08, 17:21:07] Stuart Mesham: Do we have to know the time things (like nlogn) for the searches?
[2017/06/08, 17:21:38] Luc Hayward: dont think searches are in
[2017/06/08, 17:21:51] Luc Hayward: but the time things are like meh?
[2017/06/08, 17:21:58] Stuart Mesham: It's in 2013
[2017/06/08, 17:22:09] Stuart Mesham: So binary is logn?
[2017/06/08, 17:22:19] Stuart Mesham: And linear search is just n
[2017/06/08, 17:22:22] Luc Hayward: Hmm? Binary search?
[2017/06/08, 17:22:27] Luc Hayward: Yeah and yeah
[2017/06/08, 17:22:39] Stuart Mesham: Are there any others?
[2017/06/08, 17:25:06] Luc Hayward: its not in the test
[2017/06/08, 17:25:33] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/08, 17:25:44] Luc Hayward: but yeah for sorting there's bubble, selection, merge, quick
[2017/06/08, 17:25:55] Stuart Mesham: Also it seems like try, except and finally just aren't there
[2017/06/08, 17:26:02] Luc Hayward: and searching there's sequential, binary, and that's all i can think of xD
[2017/06/08, 17:26:08] Stuart Mesham: That we have to know or nah?
[2017/06/08, 17:26:25] Luc Hayward: seems normal? d)
[2017/06/08, 17:26:36] Stuart Mesham: What is it even talking about?
[2017/06/08, 17:26:48] Luc Hayward: its what it will do ? you can't access an nonexistant value
[2017/06/08, 17:27:10] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait never mind
[2017/06/08, 17:27:15] Luc Hayward: gg
[2017/06/08, 17:27:16] Luc Hayward: \
[2017/06/08, 17:27:20] Stuart Mesham: I thought it was referring to the code at the top
[2017/06/08, 17:27:38] Stuart Mesham: ?
[2017/06/08, 17:28:02] Luc Hayward: dont need to know any this test i think
[2017/06/08, 17:29:56] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/06/08, 17:30:01] Stuart Mesham: On my way up now
[2017/06/08, 17:32:41] Luc Hayward: cool beans
[2017/06/08, 17:32:43] Luc Hayward: goodluck
[2017/06/08, 18:47:34] Stuart Mesham: Hahey! I sincerely hope string.reverse() is a thing
[2017/06/08, 18:48:12] Luc Hayward: Might be
[2017/06/08, 18:48:44] Stuart Mesham: I saw it just before I came but I'm not 100% sure if it was for lists or strings 😂
[2017/06/08, 18:49:05] Luc Hayward: I did for I in range (Len(thing)): thing. Append (thing. Pop(0))
[2017/06/08, 18:48:52] Stuart Mesham: Can I get a lift?
[2017/06/08, 18:50:01] Luc Hayward: Went with faith
[2017/06/08, 18:50:40] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/06/08, 18:50:48] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/06/08, 18:51:14] Luc Hayward: Sorry🙈
[2017/06/08, 18:51:39] Stuart Mesham: It's fine 😂
[2017/06/08, 18:52:18] Luc Hayward: Easy though?
[2017/06/08, 19:07:31] Stuart Mesham: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_reverse.htm
[2017/06/08, 19:07:37] Stuart Mesham: Yes bois yes bois
[2017/06/08, 19:07:44] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/08, 19:08:09] Stuart Mesham: And hey in this bio I think you may have done better than me
[2017/06/08, 19:08:25] Stuart Mesham: Did you watch a Kahn Academy on the last question?
[2017/06/08, 19:10:14] Luc Hayward: Don't tenderfeet
[2017/06/08, 19:10:20] Luc Hayward: Remember😂*
[2017/06/08, 19:10:27] Luc Hayward: I don't think so
[2017/06/08, 19:10:32] Luc Hayward: I knew it all
[2017/06/08, 19:10:51] Luc Hayward: But in that weird way where you know if but you can't put your thoughts down correctly on paper
[2017/06/08, 19:10:57] Stuart Mesham: Oh no I was completely stumped on the last question
[2017/06/08, 19:11:03] Stuart Mesham: I had no idea
[2017/06/08, 19:11:05] Luc Hayward: What was it?
[2017/06/08, 19:11:09] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/06/08, 19:11:18] Stuart Mesham: It was the one about the intersection of metabolic pathways
[2017/06/08, 19:11:21] Luc Hayward: The junction of anabolic and catabolic?
[2017/06/08, 19:11:23] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/06/08, 19:11:26] Luc Hayward: Shipped some bullshit
[2017/06/08, 19:11:42] Luc Hayward: Ran out of time Hardcore thou
[2017/06/08, 19:11:53] Stuart Mesham: I wrote that alpha kg could make amino acids 😂
[2017/06/08, 19:12:15] Stuart Mesham: Entirely based on that past paper question we did 🙈
[2017/06/08, 19:12:48] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/06/08, 19:13:12] Stuart Mesham: And then I said urea too because I had a bit of time and didn't have anything else to write for that question
[2017/06/08, 19:13:40] Luc Hayward: I ran out of time entirely so I just scribbled some stuff fishing for maths in the skirt answer questions
[2017/06/08, 19:13:44] Luc Hayward: Short
[2017/06/08, 19:13:43] Stuart Mesham: So I might've got 0 for that question 🤦🏻‍♂😄
[2017/06/08, 19:13:48] Luc Hayward: Marks
[2017/06/08, 19:13:52] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/06/08, 19:17:18] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/08, 19:18:28] Luc Hayward: What the fuck
[2017/06/08, 19:18:49] Stuart Mesham: Wait I got 2 marks because confirmation bias
[2017/06/08, 19:19:21] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/08, 19:41:01] Stuart Mesham: Dammit my reverse() was wrong
[2017/06/08, 19:42:36] Luc Hayward: Really?
[2017/06/08, 19:42:39] Luc Hayward: Would mine work?
[2017/06/08, 19:42:48] Luc Hayward: Appending popped values from the start
[2017/06/08, 19:42:56] Stuart Mesham: yeah
[2017/06/08, 19:43:02] Stuart Mesham: i think
[2017/06/08, 19:44:28] Stuart Mesham: i did arr1 = arr1.reverse() thinking either way (like whether it returns it or modifies it, it would work) but turns out its the modify one and it returns None
[2017/06/08, 19:45:08] Luc Hayward: Oh ffs. Python consistency
[2017/06/08, 19:45:21] Stuart Mesham: yeah damn
[2017/06/08, 19:45:44] Stuart Mesham: at least I had time to change one of mine to the long way
[2017/06/08, 19:45:49] Luc Hayward: You know the boss function? The recursive one? What did if do
[2017/06/08, 19:45:57] Stuart Mesham: max
[2017/06/08, 19:46:19] Stuart Mesham: It returned the max
[2017/06/08, 19:46:26] Luc Hayward: Ok good
[2017/06/08, 19:46:50] Stuart Mesham: I was scared because that one question about write down the output was for 2 marks and I just wrote 56
[2017/06/08, 19:48:21] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/06/08, 19:48:35] Luc Hayward: Are lists pass by reference
[2017/06/08, 19:48:42] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/08, 19:48:51] Luc Hayward: Oh thanks god
[2017/06/08, 19:53:17] Stuart Mesham: I think I'm gonna skip lectures again tomorrow
[2017/06/08, 19:53:27] Stuart Mesham: Like all of them
[2017/06/08, 20:00:39] Luc Hayward: Why
[2017/06/08, 20:00:44] Luc Hayward: It's only 3 practicals
[2017/06/08, 20:01:06] Stuart Mesham: I'll have a look
[2017/06/08, 20:54:25] Stuart Mesham: Scientific method looks too straightforward
[2017/06/08, 20:54:37] Stuart Mesham: It must be a trap 😂
[2017/06/08, 21:16:01] Stuart Mesham: It was only sort of a trap. There are just these keywords you have to know: https://quizlet.com/_3j42hz
[2017/06/09, 09:56:47] Stuart Mesham: You coming in before the test?
[2017/06/09, 10:13:32] Luc Hayward: I'm here
[2017/06/09, 10:14:30] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm in the library
[2017/06/09, 10:26:02] Luc Hayward: I'm in maths
[2017/06/09, 11:51:19] Stuart Mesham: We're both in the normal bio lecture place
[2017/06/09, 11:53:20] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/06/11, 15:26:56] Stuart Mesham: Hey Luc, sorry to bother but in the bio prac I didn't write down what colour the test tubes were at the end. What colour were yours?
[2017/06/11, 15:27:13] Luc Hayward: which prac?
[2017/06/11, 15:27:19] Luc Hayward: also fuck me maths is going to be ahrd
[2017/06/11, 15:27:26] Stuart Mesham: This last one
[2017/06/11, 15:27:32] Luc Hayward: i havent done it yet
[2017/06/11, 15:27:36] Luc Hayward: mine was on wednesday
[2017/06/11, 15:28:13] Stuart Mesham: Oh dear, I'll just be guessing what colour they were meant to be then
[2017/06/11, 15:28:31] Stuart Mesham: It's just Benedict's test so it shouldn't be too hard to guess
[2017/06/11, 15:28:44] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah
[2017/06/11, 15:29:22] Stuart Mesham: I started working though a past paper and I got this AP maths feeling
[2017/06/11, 15:29:36] Stuart Mesham: Some déjà vu
[2017/06/11, 15:29:48] Luc Hayward: I'm doing these past papers nd I literally cannot work fast enough
[2017/06/11, 15:29:53] Luc Hayward: also these derivatives are hard af
[2017/06/11, 15:30:07] Luc Hayward: like really long double derivative shit
[2017/06/11, 15:30:07] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/11, 15:30:18] Luc Hayward: and triple related rates
[2017/06/11, 15:30:33] Stuart Mesham: Related rates isn't in the test
[2017/06/11, 15:30:36] Luc Hayward: like given change in area, give the change in circumference when the radius is a value
[2017/06/11, 15:31:25] Stuart Mesham: In maths just before we started related rates Jurie said that was the end of the test stuff
[2017/06/11, 15:31:56] Stuart Mesham: He said related rates and anything after that isn't
[2017/06/11, 15:32:52] Luc Hayward: really?
[2017/06/11, 15:32:56] Luc Hayward: no related rates?
[2017/06/11, 15:33:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😄
[2017/06/11, 15:34:18] Stuart Mesham: I don't think sketching graphs either
[2017/06/11, 15:34:46] Stuart Mesham: But there is induction which I don't think is in the past papers (at least not in the one I was looking at)
[2017/06/11, 15:35:54] Luc Hayward: no graph sketching
[2017/06/11, 15:52:59] Stuart Mesham: Hey Boyd just sent me the funniest thing 😂
[2017/06/11, 15:53:25] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/06/11, 15:53:29] Stuart Mesham: They're having a volume slider competition on r/programmerhumour
[2017/06/11, 15:53:44] Luc Hayward: Yeah have you not seen this yet? Been going for ages
[2017/06/11, 15:53:46] Stuart Mesham: https://gfycat.com/PassionateOddballBlueandgoldmackaw
[2017/06/11, 15:53:48] Stuart Mesham: Back in my day, you had to roll the volume up yourself. - https://i.redd.it/xwlb42y2nx2z.gif
[2017/06/11, 15:53:50] Stuart Mesham: Volume Control should be intuitive - https://i.redd.it/012cukejqs1z.png
[2017/06/11, 15:53:52] Stuart Mesham: A simple graphical volume control - https://i.redd.it/uu79jhp0t12z.gif
[2017/06/11, 15:54:00] Stuart Mesham: Oh no I hadn't seen it before this
[2017/06/11, 15:54:11] Stuart Mesham: Such a great discovery 😂
[2017/06/12, 08:35:04] Luc Hayward: I'm pdh1 you're pdh2 tomorrow
[2017/06/12, 16:22:03] Stuart Mesham: When did Jurie do the mean value theorem?
[2017/06/12, 16:22:11] Stuart Mesham: I can't find it
[2017/06/12, 16:22:18] Luc Hayward: Did you get an email about cheating on comp sci
[2017/06/12, 16:23:53] Stuart Mesham: Yes wtf
[2017/06/12, 16:23:59] Luc Hayward: for 4 and 6?
[2017/06/12, 16:24:03] Stuart Mesham: Was assignment 6 recursion?
[2017/06/12, 16:24:18] Luc Hayward: for both or just 6??
[2017/06/12, 16:26:03] Stuart Mesham: I think just 6
[2017/06/12, 16:26:20] Stuart Mesham: Yeah just 6
[2017/06/12, 16:26:24] Stuart Mesham: Only 1 email
[2017/06/12, 16:26:50] Stuart Mesham: I was even proud of my assignment 6 because of how few lines I did it in
[2017/06/12, 16:26:58] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna fight them
[2017/06/12, 16:27:22] Luc Hayward: I got it for both
[2017/06/12, 16:27:41] Stuart Mesham: I'm sending Maria an email right now
[2017/06/12, 16:30:43] Stuart Mesham: They accused me of copying from someone with the student number fchdyl001 in the Telkom one because our while loops were the same
[2017/06/12, 16:30:54] Stuart Mesham: What the actual fuck
[2017/06/12, 16:31:03] Stuart Mesham: Isn't everyone's exactly the same??
[2017/06/12, 16:31:34] Stuart Mesham: There are only so many non-retarded ways to do something that basic
[2017/06/12, 16:45:33] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/12, 16:46:53] Stuart Mesham: Who even is Dylan Fouche??
[2017/06/12, 16:50:40] Luc Hayward: i dno
[2017/06/12, 16:50:48] Luc Hayward: but I'm going to kill jesse he sole my shit
[2017/06/12, 16:52:41] Stuart Mesham: Shit that's awkward
[2017/06/12, 16:52:54] Stuart Mesham: Now they're gonna blame it on you
[2017/06/12, 16:53:01] Luc Hayward: he fucking stole every fucking line
[2017/06/12, 16:53:18] Luc Hayward: i told him he could use it to check his for one question and he fucking took the whole thing
[2017/06/12, 16:53:24] Stuart Mesham: Did he hand it in like raw copy paste?
[2017/06/12, 16:53:47] Luc Hayward: http://moss.stanford.edu/results/514171751/match99.html
[2017/06/12, 16:54:02] Luc Hayward: diff check taht and it comes out 100% the same except for the student numbers
[2017/06/12, 16:54:55] Stuart Mesham: Oh shit that's bad
[2017/06/12, 16:58:28] Luc Hayward: could kill the shit head
[2017/06/12, 17:27:42] Luc Hayward: fuck I'm so angry with him right now. I specifically told him not to use my code. He told me he had finished it already and just wanted to see how it should have been done the cunt
[2017/06/12, 18:00:35] Stuart Mesham: Sorry man
[2017/06/12, 18:00:46] Luc Hayward: It's fine
[2017/06/12, 18:00:54] Luc Hayward: Should have read the course codes more clearly
[2017/06/12, 18:01:13] Luc Hayward: Not actually even allowed to give specific coding advice it's such bulkshit
[2017/06/12, 18:02:01] Stuart Mesham: Like you're not even supposed to talk about the assignments?
[2017/06/12, 18:02:42] Luc Hayward: Read the notes to students
[2017/06/12, 18:03:13] Luc Hayward: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8uMx2tv05SbQVZ5NGNhcWdRMnc
[2017/06/12, 18:03:17] Luc Hayward: down at the bottom
[2017/06/12, 18:03:25] Luc Hayward: well just above the challenge assignments section
[2017/06/12, 18:03:29] Luc Hayward: goes into detail
[2017/06/12, 18:10:59] Stuart Mesham: That's pretty bs we basically aren't allowed to say anything more than "oh that assignment's about loops" to each other
[2017/06/12, 18:11:18] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/06/12, 18:11:50] Stuart Mesham: Anyway, just thought you might want to know, mean value theorem isn't in the maths test
[2017/06/12, 18:14:54] Luc Hayward: it isnt?
[2017/06/12, 18:14:56] Luc Hayward: mooi
[2017/06/12, 20:29:46] Luc Hayward: On a related note, I see that the policy stipulates that all discussion of assignments is prohibited unless it is more general than pseudocode/flow diagrams unless otherwise stipulated by the lecturer. Does this imply that at the lecturer's discretion students may be allowed to brainstorm and/or critique their peers' programs? Or is anything more in-depth than a general discussion of the broader requirements prohibited at all times?
[2017/06/12, 20:29:50] Luc Hayward: sent that to maria for answers
[2017/06/12, 20:30:50] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm just finishing composing another of my own emails to her
[2017/06/12, 20:30:57] Luc Hayward: also she refused to waive the mark against my record
[2017/06/12, 20:31:20] Luc Hayward: from her: Thing is, that you should never have shared the code, as you indeed
realised, belatedly, as well. We are aware that such unfortunate events
happen sometimes and that therewith trust and friendships are tested. It
will not be overlooked, however, and the penalty remains at least for this
assignment (4).
[2017/06/12, 20:34:19] Luc Hayward: oh?
[2017/06/12, 20:35:03] Stuart Mesham: Lemme copy paste the emails here
[2017/06/12, 20:35:22] Luc Hayward: do you know how to evaluate this?
lim x-> infinity of sqrt(x^2+5x-5) - sqrtx^2+2x-4)
[2017/06/12, 20:35:35] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/12, 20:35:47] Luc Hayward: can you explain for me?
[2017/06/12, 20:36:00] Luc Hayward: i thought they both just went to infinity
[2017/06/12, 20:36:14] Stuart Mesham: So if you take out x^4 as a common factor
[2017/06/12, 20:36:37] Stuart Mesham: Then within each sqrt you're dividing each term by x^2
[2017/06/12, 20:36:53] Luc Hayward: am i>?
[2017/06/12, 20:37:44] Stuart Mesham: Yeah imagine first taking out x^4 from each sqrt sign separately
[2017/06/12, 20:38:21] Stuart Mesham: Like if you have sqrt(3*4) it's equal to 2sqrt(3)
[2017/06/12, 20:38:34] Luc Hayward: yes
[2017/06/12, 20:40:12] Luc Hayward: but if you take x^4 out of a square root, arent i left with everything in the square root to the power 1/8?
[2017/06/12, 20:41:36] Stuart Mesham: Inside the first sqrt you'll end up with 1 + 5/x - 5/x^2
[2017/06/12, 20:42:32] Luc Hayward: ok brb when you finish typing
[2017/06/12, 20:42:36] Luc Hayward: not following here...
[2017/06/12, 20:42:58] Stuart Mesham: Then as x tends to infinity 5/x and 5/x^2 both tend to 0 so inside that sqrt you end up with sqrt(1 + 0 + 0)
[2017/06/12, 20:56:28] Stuart Mesham: Hi, soz went to the toilet
[2017/06/12, 20:56:37] Stuart Mesham: But check lecture 31
[2017/06/12, 20:56:50] Stuart Mesham: Like page 4
[2017/06/12, 20:57:02] Stuart Mesham: There are examples of this
[2017/06/12, 21:18:34] Stuart Mesham: My goodness this comp sci has wasted so much time
[2017/06/12, 21:18:41] Stuart Mesham: I'm still on 2015
[2017/06/12, 21:18:50] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/06/12, 21:19:07] Luc Hayward: I understand now
[2017/06/12, 21:19:14] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/06/12, 21:20:07] Luc Hayward: had to multiply by conjugate thingy
[2017/06/12, 21:20:51] Stuart Mesham: Oh I was wrong
[2017/06/12, 21:21:51] Luc Hayward: yyeah
[2017/06/12, 22:06:24] Stuart Mesham: You know for induction you have to write that little bit at the end? (and also the bits in the middle)
[2017/06/12, 22:06:48] Stuart Mesham: Do you know where we can find a complete example that we would get full marks for?
[2017/06/12, 22:06:52] Luc Hayward: Yeah?
[2017/06/12, 22:06:55] Luc Hayward: Khan academy
[2017/06/12, 22:07:22] Stuart Mesham: https://vula.uct.ac.za/access/content/group/043d56e8-86da-4784-9c4d-041ac778590b/Lecture%20notes%20first%20period/answers2.pdf I got this one but it looks like he was taking shortcuts so we might not get full marks for this
[2017/06/12, 22:08:22] Luc Hayward: That's fine
[2017/06/12, 22:08:25] Luc Hayward: State rtp
[2017/06/12, 22:08:29] Luc Hayward: Give base case
[2017/06/12, 22:08:40] Luc Hayward: Assume true for n = k
[2017/06/12, 22:08:52] Luc Hayward: Prove for K+1 using the assumption
[2017/06/12, 22:09:10] Luc Hayward: Thus by the principle of mathematical induction we have proven the statement
[2017/06/12, 22:09:21] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks
[2017/06/12, 22:11:29] Luc Hayward: No stress
[2017/06/12, 22:12:15] Stuart Mesham: Stress bru
[2017/06/12, 22:12:25] Luc Hayward: I'm going to bed fuck this test
[2017/06/12, 22:12:51] Stuart Mesham: I think I might actually skip a bunch of lectures tomorrow
[2017/06/12, 22:13:19] Stuart Mesham: I'll just show up for chem then go to the library and maths until 6pm
[2017/06/12, 22:13:48] Stuart Mesham: Will catch up lectures on Thursday
[2017/06/12, 22:16:11] Luc Hayward: Chemistry have been recording
[2017/06/12, 22:16:24] Stuart Mesham: Oh awesome
[2017/06/12, 22:16:44] Stuart Mesham: I'll give my self some extra sleep then
[2017/06/12, 22:16:54] Luc Hayward: Havent
[2017/06/12, 22:16:58] Stuart Mesham: I'll be bright eyed and bushy tailed for the maths test
[2017/06/12, 22:16:59] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/06/12, 22:17:07] Stuart Mesham: Well still
[2017/06/12, 22:17:20] Stuart Mesham: I'll just go to Chem
[2017/06/12, 22:18:29] Luc Hayward: And maths
[2017/06/12, 22:18:39] Luc Hayward: I'll be in mlc from 1
[2017/06/12, 22:19:21] Stuart Mesham: Maths is recording
[2017/06/12, 22:19:54] Stuart Mesham: If other maths lecturer is doing revision then I'll go to that too
[2017/06/12, 22:21:28] Luc Hayward: Probaby curve sketching ? So that's derivatives
[2017/06/12, 22:22:03] Stuart Mesham: Ok decide tomorrow
[2017/06/12, 22:22:14] Stuart Mesham: I'll be at Chem
[2017/06/12, 22:22:31] Luc Hayward: Kk

[2017/06/13, 20:48:57] Luc Hayward: Don't have it on me will send it tomorrow
[2017/06/13, 20:49:16] Stuart Mesham: Cool thanks 👌🏻
[2017/06/14, 16:18:48] Luc Hayward: You on campus?
[2017/06/14, 16:25:03] Stuart Mesham: I think I'll come to the library if you're there
[2017/06/14, 16:25:18] Stuart Mesham: I can't get myself to stop procrastinating here 😆
[2017/06/14, 16:25:40] Luc Hayward: Ok😂👌🏻
[2017/06/14, 16:25:52] Stuart Mesham: Up top in the library?
[2017/06/14, 16:26:07] Luc Hayward: Coffee place
[2017/06/14, 16:26:16] Stuart Mesham: Ok see you now
[2017/06/14, 16:46:27] Luc Hayward: Where you at

[2017/06/14, 19:05:19] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait 10 minutes ago
[2017/06/14, 19:05:25] Stuart Mesham: No worries
[2017/06/14, 19:05:38] Stuart Mesham: Such a chilled test though 👌🏻
[2017/06/14, 19:19:43] Luc Hayward: So chilled right ?
[2017/06/14, 19:42:22] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/14, 20:28:45] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/14, 20:29:04] Luc Hayward: I'm going to bed fuck sunny
[2017/06/14, 20:29:20] Stuart Mesham: But you have to write down something 😂
[2017/06/14, 20:29:32] Luc Hayward: I'll write fuck sunny
[2017/06/14, 20:29:39] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/06/15, 11:52:34] Stuart Mesham: You coming to bio?
[2017/06/15, 11:53:11] Luc Hayward: Ye bio
[2017/06/16, 17:10:39] Stuart Mesham: In our exam timetables I'm sports center 2 for maths
[2017/06/16, 17:11:26] Stuart Mesham: Also for comp sci we've got 5pm on the calendar but my Vula thing says 4:30pm for comp sci
[2017/06/16, 17:13:01] Stuart Mesham: And for maths and the 2 bio exams I've got one event organised by "UCT" and the other organised by "Luc Hayward", which ones should I delete/are you going to update in future?
[2017/06/16, 19:21:48] Luc Hayward: Delete uct
[2017/06/16, 19:22:04] Luc Hayward: Will change all of those tomorrow night just tell me what to do :)
[2017/06/16, 20:53:07] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/06/18, 11:46:56] Luc Hayward: Ay you check the challenge email for comp sci
[2017/06/18, 11:48:41] Stuart Mesham: I don't get it. Did she put new ones up?
[2017/06/18, 11:56:02] Luc Hayward: No but the competition closes tomorrow night
[2017/06/18, 12:57:27] Luc Hayward: wil you look at my bio tomorrow see if theres anything to add?
[2017/06/18, 14:12:26] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/06/18, 17:28:56] Stuart Mesham: I did the library one but it only half accepted my answer ☹️
[2017/06/18, 17:29:33] Stuart Mesham: Then I tried again and it still didn't accept it ☹️
[2017/06/18, 17:35:57] Luc Hayward: Never even looked
[2017/06/19, 08:20:43] Luc Hayward: You coming today?
[2017/06/19, 08:43:12] Stuart Mesham: Yeah, on my way to Chem just now
[2017/06/19, 08:43:21] Luc Hayward: K
[2017/06/19, 08:49:09] Luc Hayward: Take a Set of noted for me
[2017/06/19, 08:59:11] Stuart Mesham: Are _you_ at chem
[2017/06/19, 08:59:13] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/06/21, 17:15:31] Stuart Mesham: How do you do 3a on the Chem tut?
[2017/06/21, 17:36:33] Stuart Mesham: Nvm, Khan Academy to the rescue
[2017/06/21, 18:26:11] Luc Hayward: fuck! i forgot the chem tut
[2017/06/21, 20:26:30] Stuart Mesham: Ah classic
[2017/06/21, 20:33:59] Luc Hayward: How long to complete
[2017/06/21, 20:34:11] Stuart Mesham: Not thaaaat long
[2017/06/21, 20:34:18] Luc Hayward: 1hour
[2017/06/21, 20:40:02] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/06/21, 20:41:06] Stuart Mesham: Yeah you can do it in 1 hour
[2017/06/21, 20:41:39] Stuart Mesham: Have you been busy with something that I'm also supposed to have done??
[2017/06/21, 20:41:47] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/06/21, 20:47:17] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool
[2017/06/22, 10:21:49] Stuart Mesham: Oh lol, I won't be at comp sci either, the appointment was actually at 11
[2017/06/22, 10:21:59] Luc Hayward: Not going to comp sci
[2017/06/22, 12:46:06] Stuart Mesham: You coming to 2pm maths tut?
[2017/06/22, 12:58:07] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/06/22, 13:01:59] Luc Hayward: I'm in the wrong fucking lecture here.
[2017/06/22, 13:02:15] Stuart Mesham: What? 😂

[2017/06/22, 13:02:38] Luc Hayward: I was just busy working on my laptop and all these people walked in....
[2017/06/22, 13:02:57] Stuart Mesham: What is that? 😂
[2017/06/22, 13:02:59] Luc Hayward: I don't know where u am but it's not a good place
[2017/06/22, 13:03:05] Luc Hayward: It's nlt
[2017/06/22, 13:03:23] Stuart Mesham: Oh shame, enjoy the lecture 😂
[2017/06/22, 13:03:51] Stuart Mesham: You could make a sneaky disappearance out the back door on the left
[2017/06/22, 13:11:07] Luc Hayward: I'm leaving in 20 min half way through
[2017/06/22, 13:11:48] Stuart Mesham: What course is it?
[2017/06/22, 13:17:10] Luc Hayward: It's a lecture on postgraduate funding
[2017/06/22, 13:27:33] Stuart Mesham: Sounds boring
[2017/06/22, 13:27:44] Stuart Mesham: Best you get out of there
[2017/06/22, 13:31:29] Luc Hayward: I ran
[2017/06/22, 13:34:27] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/06/25, 18:29:13] Luc Hayward: chelmistry tomorrow or nah?
[2017/06/25, 20:31:56] Stuart Mesham: I thought there weren't any lectures this week
[2017/06/25, 20:32:43] Stuart Mesham: Sunny said he was doing a lecture on Thursday on the self study stuff
[2017/06/25, 20:34:12] Luc Hayward: So it's there anything tomorrow
[2017/06/25, 20:34:16] Luc Hayward: Is
[2017/06/25, 20:53:05] Stuart Mesham: I don't think so
[2017/06/25, 21:09:14] Luc Hayward: Ah oj

[2017/06/25, 21:22:40] Luc Hayward: Are you sure enough lectures ?
[2017/06/25, 21:23:56] Stuart Mesham: Dan said UCT is pretty much closed during the 2 days before exams
[2017/06/25, 21:24:34] Stuart Mesham: Also I watched Jurie's lecture video from Friday and he said it was his last lecture with us
[2017/06/25, 21:24:43] Stuart Mesham: So definitely no maths or bio
[2017/06/25, 21:24:52] Stuart Mesham: Or comp sci
[2017/06/25, 21:25:06] Stuart Mesham: I don't _think_ there's chemistry
[2017/06/25, 21:25:55] Stuart Mesham: If there is I'm sure it'll be recorded anyway so we'll see it
[2017/06/25, 21:31:42] Luc Hayward: Oh nice
[2017/06/25, 21:31:47] Luc Hayward: George said the same

[2017/06/26, 18:43:47] Stuart Mesham: You should be jealous
[2017/06/26, 18:44:00] Luc Hayward: I'm jeally
[2017/06/26, 18:44:15] Stuart Mesham: But hey I just found that while I was young and foolish
[2017/06/26, 18:44:23] Stuart Mesham: Bright eyed and bushy tailed
[2017/06/26, 18:44:40] Stuart Mesham: I made bio notes
[2017/06/26, 18:45:04] Stuart Mesham: So I've got bio notes on the origins of life that I can send you
[2017/06/26, 18:53:42] Luc Hayward: thanks
[2017/06/26, 18:53:48] Luc Hayward: you procrastinated hard with the art
[2017/06/26, 18:54:14] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I really did wow
[2017/06/26, 18:54:43] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/qFGx9QcE5Gk
[2017/06/26, 18:58:47] Stuart Mesham: Oh my word that is so cool
[2017/06/26, 18:58:55] Luc Hayward: right>
[2017/06/26, 18:59:21] Stuart Mesham: It seems to be as good as Tango
[2017/06/26, 18:59:39] Luc Hayward: can you name your notes with an s or a stu at the start ?
[2017/06/26, 18:59:43] Luc Hayward: yeah its really good
[2017/06/26, 19:00:00] Stuart Mesham: Like the word docs or the folder?
[2017/06/26, 19:00:34] Stuart Mesham: And they did it without the extra sensors which is really cool
[2017/06/26, 19:00:46] Luc Hayward: the folder
[2017/06/26, 19:00:51] Luc Hayward: yeah super cool
[2017/06/26, 21:32:12] Luc Hayward: You gonna go tomorrow for the prize giving thingy? And the revision lecture for comp sci?
[2017/06/26, 21:32:33] Stuart Mesham: Noope
[2017/06/26, 21:32:38] Stuart Mesham: Bio bio bio
[2017/06/26, 21:32:47] Luc Hayward: Yeah my plan too
[2017/06/26, 21:33:16] Stuart Mesham: I actually would've liked to go though
[2017/06/26, 21:33:37] Stuart Mesham: But it's not really worth it this week
[2017/06/26, 21:45:09] Luc Hayward: Yeah I know. I really wanted to see the solutions
[2017/06/26, 21:45:34] Luc Hayward: Kind of tempting to go but like bio. Email her and ask if there is a possibility of it being recorded?
[2017/06/26, 21:58:29] Stuart Mesham: I don't want to email her 😂
[2017/06/26, 21:58:39] Luc Hayward: I'll email too
[2017/06/26, 21:58:44] Stuart Mesham: Ask Keegan to say something in the chat
[2017/06/26, 21:58:55] Luc Hayward: Keegan won't😂
[2017/06/26, 21:58:58] Stuart Mesham: She doesn't know who he is
[2017/06/26, 21:59:14] Stuart Mesham: He's in the perfect position to ask for stuff 😄
[2017/06/26, 21:59:34] Luc Hayward: How he isn't in any way past of the challenge series.
[2017/06/26, 21:59:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😂
[2017/06/26, 22:00:04] Stuart Mesham: So she has nothing against him
[2017/06/26, 22:00:25] Luc Hayward: And no reason to help either.
[2017/06/26, 22:01:24] Stuart Mesham: Well she'll be willing to help kindle an interest in comp sci and inspire future generations
[2017/06/26, 22:01:39] Luc Hayward: Seems unlikely. I've tried it for you
[2017/06/26, 22:02:01] Stuart Mesham: Maybe he'd never coded before so he didn't do the challenges but was really interested 😄
[2017/06/26, 22:02:14] Stuart Mesham: Did you send an email?
[2017/06/26, 22:04:07] Luc Hayward: Dear Dr Keet
Would it be in any way possible to have the discussion on solutions to the challenge series recorded tomorrow? Or perhaps the solutions might be posted on Vula at some point? My friend Stuart and I are unfortunately unable to attend in the midst of exam preparation but are very keen to compare our solutions with those of the department. 
Regards, 
Luc Hayward and Stuart Mesham
[2017/06/26, 22:05:03] Stuart Mesham: Aaaaahhhh no 😂

[2017/06/26, 22:08:44] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/06/26, 22:08:58] Luc Hayward: Everyone is doing really interesting stuff though once you look into it
[2017/06/26, 22:12:36] Stuart Mesham: Oh my word her CV is so long and so impressive it's actually hard to believe
[2017/06/27, 10:55:51] Luc Hayward: can you give me editing rights to the folde
[2017/06/27, 11:00:43] Stuart Mesham: I don't want you to edit stuff 🙅🏻‍♂
[2017/06/27, 11:00:57] Stuart Mesham: Oh sorry, I forgot to change the folder name
[2017/06/27, 11:01:02] Stuart Mesham: I'll do it now
[2017/06/27, 11:02:29] Stuart Mesham: Does non editing cause issues?
[2017/06/27, 11:06:38] Luc Hayward: Nah chilled
[2017/06/27, 11:06:42] Luc Hayward: 👌
[2017/06/27, 11:06:57] Luc Hayward: Wow there is just so much
[2017/06/27, 11:07:13] Stuart Mesham: You mean bio in general?
[2017/06/27, 11:07:19] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/06/27, 11:07:24] Stuart Mesham: Yeeah
[2017/06/27, 11:07:49] Stuart Mesham: There is just so so much
[2017/06/27, 11:08:35] Stuart Mesham: Some of this is just going to have to come down to * gasp * long term memory 🙈
[2017/06/27, 11:13:41] Luc Hayward: I have tons of past papers
[2017/06/27, 11:18:02] Luc Hayward: 5 now
[2017/06/27, 11:18:36] Stuart Mesham: Where did you get them?
[2017/06/27, 11:18:53] Luc Hayward: mwahaha I'll give them to you
[2017/06/27, 11:19:07] Stuart Mesham: What? 😂
[2017/06/27, 11:19:22] Stuart Mesham: Did you find someone who did bio last year?
[2017/06/27, 11:20:27] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/06/27, 11:20:40] Luc Hayward: got them from the exam folders
[2017/06/27, 11:21:02] Stuart Mesham: Aren't those just the ones from Vula?
[2017/06/27, 11:21:09] Luc Hayward: yes
[2017/06/27, 11:21:24] Luc Hayward: plus exam papers they didnt give us
[2017/06/27, 11:21:47] Stuart Mesham: Oh wow you did find some
[2017/06/27, 11:21:50] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/06/27, 11:23:12] Luc Hayward: I rate we study the shit out of this today and tomorrow and then meetup on thursday to go over all the past papers?
[2017/06/27, 11:25:03] Stuart Mesham: I want to try and get through all the lecture slides before doing the past papers
[2017/06/27, 11:25:13] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/06/27, 11:25:33] Stuart Mesham: So if do get through all of them then that's a good idea 👌🏻
[2017/06/27, 11:25:35] Luc Hayward: so today and tomorrow cus we basically should remember adam and chimphango and most of heather
[2017/06/27, 11:25:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/27, 11:28:29] Luc Hayward: ok study up time and we can see how far we got tonight
[2017/06/27, 11:29:18] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/27, 11:29:22] Stuart Mesham: Chat later 👌🏻
[2017/06/27, 14:34:55] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/27, 14:37:42] Stuart Mesham: Never mind, figured it out
[2017/06/27, 14:54:51] Luc Hayward: Where is that from
[2017/06/27, 17:04:43] Luc Hayward: How was your maths mark
[2017/06/27, 17:48:15] Stuart Mesham: From here: www.juandiegoacademy.org/userfiles/28/Classes/8910/04_test_bank.doc?id=6052
[2017/06/27, 17:48:32] Stuart Mesham: It was good 👍🏻
[2017/06/27, 17:48:35] Stuart Mesham: 79
[2017/06/27, 17:48:37] Stuart Mesham: Happy
[2017/06/27, 17:49:53] Luc Hayward: Fucking hell
[2017/06/27, 17:50:06] Stuart Mesham: ?
[2017/06/27, 17:50:09] Luc Hayward: Everyone else did so shit
[2017/06/27, 17:50:25] Stuart Mesham: Oh 😂
[2017/06/27, 17:50:33] Stuart Mesham: You included?
[2017/06/27, 17:51:12] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/06/27, 17:51:22] Stuart Mesham: Oh sorry
[2017/06/27, 17:51:31] Luc Hayward: All good
[2017/06/27, 17:51:38] Luc Hayward: Will go through that test tomorrow
[2017/06/27, 17:51:55] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/27, 17:52:19] Stuart Mesham: Did Maria just flatly ignore us?
[2017/06/27, 17:59:56] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/06/27, 18:00:05] Luc Hayward: Straight up
[2017/06/27, 18:07:46] Stuart Mesham: See we should've got Keegan to send it 😄
[2017/06/27, 18:08:02] Luc Hayward: Send again next week
[2017/06/27, 18:11:46] Stuart Mesham: Yeah, I'll send one then
[2017/06/27, 18:51:29] Luc Hayward: Ok so plan is meet in Thursday for a study day?
[2017/06/27, 20:21:19] Stuart Mesham: Kinda depends on how tomorrow goes, I'd say
[2017/06/27, 20:47:24] Luc Hayward: Oh ok
[2017/06/28, 09:39:20] Luc Hayward: hey man
[2017/06/28, 11:01:36] Stuart Mesham: Sup
[2017/06/28, 11:01:50] Stuart Mesham: I saw Maria's email
[2017/06/28, 11:09:06] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/06/28, 11:09:14] Luc Hayward: thinking to head in on friday maybe
[2017/06/28, 11:10:07] Luc Hayward: also I want to find out who our lecturers are for next semester and see if we can get early access to the notes or at least the course outline
[2017/06/28, 11:10:22] Luc Hayward: and I shared with you my notes
[2017/06/28, 11:10:26] Luc Hayward: well some of them
[2017/06/28, 11:11:11] Stuart Mesham: Is this to decide what course to do?
[2017/06/28, 11:11:22] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/06/28, 11:11:35] Luc Hayward: just to see what we are doing
[2017/06/28, 11:11:44] Stuart Mesham: Preemptive studying?
[2017/06/28, 11:11:46] Luc Hayward: I meant our comp sci stuff
[2017/06/28, 11:11:48] Luc Hayward: yeh
[2017/06/28, 11:11:50] Luc Hayward: xD
[2017/06/28, 11:11:51] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/06/28, 11:12:25] Luc Hayward: Like would be helpful to atleast have a broad knowledge of whatever we were intended to learn
[2017/06/28, 11:12:32] Stuart Mesham: Lol why? We need to sit through the course anyway to get into second year so you can't skip it 😂
[2017/06/28, 11:12:41] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/06/28, 11:12:55] Stuart Mesham: But it'll probably just be object oriented programming
[2017/06/28, 11:13:21] Luc Hayward: theres a lot more theory this semester though
[2017/06/28, 11:13:32] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/06/28, 11:13:45] Luc Hayward: and no michelle makes a big return with parallel computing in the second half of the course
[2017/06/28, 11:13:43] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I guess that could be helpful
[2017/06/28, 11:14:10] Stuart Mesham: Wohoo! 😄
[2017/06/28, 11:14:29] Stuart Mesham: It's gonna be great
[2017/06/28, 11:14:38] Luc Hayward: I'm hoping her notes are improved over the ones I found on her website though
[2017/06/28, 11:14:41] Luc Hayward: those are hideous
[2017/06/28, 11:15:22] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah but I ended up watching YouTube videos to explain the sorting etc.
[2017/06/28, 11:15:45] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/06/28, 11:15:47] Luc Hayward: ah ok
[2017/06/28, 11:15:49] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/06/28, 11:16:04] Luc Hayward: I think I've got those down but will probably refresh them with youtube
[2017/06/28, 11:21:16] Luc Hayward: But yeah I've got a month of holiday I'd and I'm away for most of it (ie not at my desktop) so I'd like to get something useful done whether it be writing a new game or learning the broad coursework in java or something
[2017/06/28, 11:21:39] Luc Hayward: also ios public beta is up i think
[2017/06/28, 11:32:46] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that's a good idea
[2017/06/28, 11:37:37] Luc Hayward: anyway
[2017/06/28, 11:37:40] Luc Hayward: hows bio coming
[2017/06/28, 11:38:53] Stuart Mesham: I'm almost finished Heather's first section
[2017/06/28, 11:39:03] Stuart Mesham: The chemicals of life section
[2017/06/28, 11:39:11] Luc Hayward: so you've only done mike and heather so far>?
[2017/06/28, 11:39:21] Stuart Mesham: And I've done her last section
[2017/06/28, 11:39:27] Luc Hayward: ah ok
[2017/06/28, 11:39:28] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/28, 11:39:40] Stuart Mesham: So just Adam and Samson after this
[2017/06/28, 11:39:50] Luc Hayward: and also terry
[2017/06/28, 11:40:01] Stuart Mesham: Oh damn
[2017/06/28, 11:40:04] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/06/28, 11:40:09] Stuart Mesham: Terry's gonna be bad
[2017/06/28, 11:40:24] Luc Hayward: But terry wonts be too bad because he can't ask massively in depth questions this time
[2017/06/28, 11:40:31] Luc Hayward: there isnt time for him to do that
[2017/06/28, 11:40:40] Stuart Mesham: Good
[2017/06/28, 11:41:15] Luc Hayward: check your email you'll see I've sent you the "Things you should be able to asnwer"for heathers section on chemicals
[2017/06/28, 11:41:21] Stuart Mesham: I don't want massively in depth questions about transcription factors and t-acylsjdjchfnsksodjase 😂
[2017/06/28, 11:41:35] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/06/28, 11:41:54] Luc Hayward: oh fuck we have to learn all the dna replication shit hey
[2017/06/28, 11:42:15] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that's the issue 😬
[2017/06/28, 11:42:15] Luc Hayward: will be complete by 12
[2017/06/28, 11:42:35] Stuart Mesham: Ok don't stress I still have to have breakfast
[2017/06/28, 11:42:58] Luc Hayward: 😂 I've been up since 9 catching up yesterday where I slacked off
[2017/06/28, 11:43:29] Stuart Mesham: Oh I did the opposite 😄
[2017/06/28, 11:44:14] Stuart Mesham: Yesterday I ploughed through all Mike and Heather's stuff and then was so over it in the evening I stayed up late watching YouTube 🙈
[2017/06/28, 11:44:26] Stuart Mesham: So I just woke up at 11 today
[2017/06/28, 11:46:45] Luc Hayward: so now we're even xD
[2017/06/28, 11:56:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/28, 14:30:41] Luc Hayward: Ugh my god there's so much more
[2017/06/28, 14:36:55] Luc Hayward: ok done
[2017/06/28, 14:37:52] Luc Hayward: oh terry is a cunt
[2017/06/28, 14:38:04] Luc Hayward: he doesnt provide "Things you should be able to answer
[2017/06/28, 15:29:13] Luc Hayward: If you don't want to meet tomorrow can we at least meet on Friday to discuss the past papers and the answers to the earlier tests?
[2017/06/28, 15:29:28] Luc Hayward: There are simple questions that I don't know the answers to

[2017/06/28, 15:33:09] Luc Hayward: Found the answers. What kak I should've been given the marks
[2017/06/28, 16:22:24] Stuart Mesham: Wow I still cannot answer those questions
[2017/06/28, 16:23:35] Stuart Mesham: How did you get through Terry's stuff so quickly?
[2017/06/28, 16:24:25] Luc Hayward: I didn't
[2017/06/28, 16:26:55] Luc Hayward: I'm still on cell cycles
[2017/06/28, 16:33:18] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool me too 😄
[2017/06/28, 16:33:57] Stuart Mesham: Khan Academy to the rescue because Terry's slides on cdks etc. are cryptic af
[2017/06/28, 16:44:12] Luc Hayward: I watched khan academy stuff
[2017/06/28, 16:44:16] Luc Hayward: It's like an hour long
[2017/06/28, 16:52:47] Luc Hayward: there I sent them all to you if you weant them for offline
[2017/06/28, 17:03:38] Luc Hayward: the problem is that the stuff in the textbook, the stuff in his slides and the stuff in the notes he gives us for the first three slideshows are all different
[2017/06/28, 17:03:50] Luc Hayward: they all only share maybe half the work
[2017/06/28, 17:12:10] Luc Hayward: ⁠⁠⁠ugh i hate cells. why doesnt everything just happen by mgic. why do we have to KNOW things
[2017/06/28, 17:15:00] Luc Hayward: terry has the huge ass section and its only worth 20%
[2017/06/28, 20:13:39] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/06/28, 20:14:33] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I've stuck mostly to the PowerPoints for Mike's section + chemicals of life
[2017/06/29, 10:31:02] Luc Hayward: Tell me if you do any other nice notes
[2017/06/29, 11:24:47] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/29, 11:34:51] Luc Hayward: What time do you write tomorrow
[2017/06/29, 12:16:48] Stuart Mesham: Did you use the pretty notes? 😄
[2017/06/29, 12:17:17] Stuart Mesham: And Terry's last powerpoint is so over the top 😑
[2017/06/29, 12:17:36] Stuart Mesham: I'm same time as you but in a different place
[2017/06/29, 12:39:43] Luc Hayward: Yes!
[2017/06/29, 12:39:52] Luc Hayward: Oh ok
[2017/06/29, 12:39:56] Luc Hayward: How log do you get
[2017/06/29, 12:39:58] Luc Hayward: Also
[2017/06/29, 12:40:12] Luc Hayward: Let's meet tomorrow to discuss stuff ? 🤞🤞
[2017/06/29, 12:40:18] Luc Hayward: Can lift you in afterwards
[2017/06/29, 12:57:50] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/06/29, 17:05:00] Luc Hayward: This is literally just cram you ass off and hope to god you remember the stuff they ask
[2017/06/29, 17:05:16] Luc Hayward: Because there's not a good in hell you can learn all this shit
[2017/06/29, 17:05:37] Stuart Mesham: Yes! I got this right this time 😄
[2017/06/29, 17:06:00] Stuart Mesham: Just came back to check the chat to see if my answer was right 🙈
[2017/06/29, 17:06:10] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/06/29, 17:06:17] Stuart Mesham: Yep
[2017/06/29, 17:06:20] Luc Hayward: I'm so so so fucked
[2017/06/29, 17:06:28] Luc Hayward: Only finishing my notes for Terry now
[2017/06/29, 17:06:42] Stuart Mesham: You made notes?
[2017/06/29, 17:06:48] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/06/29, 17:07:02] Stuart Mesham: Fuck Terry's slides are too much
[2017/06/29, 17:07:44] Luc Hayward: Then for chimphango and Adam I'm just going to try rote learn the steps for glycolysis, respiration and photosynthesis. Then on to heather
[2017/06/29, 17:07:43] Stuart Mesham: I had to resort to looking a few of the slides up in the textbook near the end of Terry's because I just had no idea what was cracking in the slides
[2017/06/29, 17:07:52] Luc Hayward: Yeah same
[2017/06/29, 17:08:13] Stuart Mesham: I think I've got Terry's section mostly though
[2017/06/29, 17:08:42] Stuart Mesham: Again, yep
[2017/06/29, 17:08:43] Stuart Mesham: Yep
[2017/06/29, 17:08:45] Stuart Mesham: Yep
[2017/06/29, 17:08:47] Luc Hayward: Anyway
[2017/06/29, 17:08:58] Luc Hayward: Are we meeting tomorrow to discuss past papers
[2017/06/29, 17:09:13] Stuart Mesham: I'm waking up at 7 tomorrow 😂
[2017/06/29, 17:09:23] Luc Hayward: So am I 😂😂
[2017/06/29, 17:09:54] Stuart Mesham: Should we go straight to UCT and meet there? When does the morning traffic end?
[2017/06/29, 17:10:13] Stuart Mesham: I'm at home
[2017/06/29, 17:10:31] Stuart Mesham: I just don't want to go too early and then waste time in traffic
[2017/06/29, 17:10:33] Luc Hayward: So am I, let's rather meet at you and then go through ?
[2017/06/29, 17:10:44] Luc Hayward: At least at yours there is tea and rusks
[2017/06/29, 17:10:56] Stuart Mesham: Yeah good idea
[2017/06/29, 17:11:02] Luc Hayward: Then we can head through before the exam instead of being in a loud library
[2017/06/29, 17:11:18] Stuart Mesham: Yeah plan
[2017/06/29, 17:11:20] Luc Hayward: How long do you think we need for papers ?
[2017/06/29, 17:11:30] Stuart Mesham: I have no idea 🙈
[2017/06/29, 17:11:44] Stuart Mesham: Let's just give ourselves as much time as possible
[2017/06/29, 17:12:04] Luc Hayward: Well like we should leave your place at say 1. So shall we meet at 10? Later/Earlier?
[2017/06/29, 17:12:25] Stuart Mesham: Yeah let's say 10 for now
[2017/06/29, 17:12:30] Stuart Mesham: Maybe 9:30
[2017/06/29, 17:12:58] Stuart Mesham: I don't want to cut it too fine arriving at UCT because I need to find the extra time place etc.
[2017/06/29, 17:13:29] Luc Hayward: Yeah. 🤞🤞
[2017/06/29, 17:13:46] Luc Hayward: I'll come between 9:30 and 10
[2017/06/29, 17:14:26] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool
[2017/06/29, 17:14:56] Luc Hayward: How long does heather's section take
[2017/06/29, 17:15:13] Stuart Mesham: Immune system?
[2017/06/29, 17:15:26] Luc Hayward: Yeah as cell signalling
[2017/06/29, 17:15:41] Stuart Mesham: Sorry to say that's a kak one 😂
[2017/06/29, 17:15:45] Stuart Mesham: I'm so sorry
[2017/06/29, 17:15:54] Luc Hayward: 😂😂 fuck really ?
[2017/06/29, 17:15:59] Luc Hayward: Compare it to terry
[2017/06/29, 17:16:17] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I spent Saturday and Sunday on that
[2017/06/29, 17:16:25] Stuart Mesham: I'm so so sorry
[2017/06/29, 17:16:44] Luc Hayward: Bah humbug it cannot be that long. I'll just only study what we got from Sam xD
[2017/06/29, 17:16:55] Stuart Mesham: Watch the Khan Academy on the immune system
[2017/06/29, 17:16:59] Stuart Mesham: That's key
[2017/06/29, 17:17:05] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/06/29, 17:17:11] Stuart Mesham: I didn't really understand anything until I watched those
[2017/06/29, 17:17:32] Stuart Mesham: Then study notes etc. to fill in details
[2017/06/29, 17:17:39] Luc Hayward: Right right
[2017/06/29, 17:17:58] Stuart Mesham: Dunno about cell signalling though
[2017/06/29, 17:18:00] Stuart Mesham: Ouch
[2017/06/29, 17:18:20] Stuart Mesham: The textbook section is long but I went through it
[2017/06/29, 17:18:38] Luc Hayward: Cell sognalling wast huge. It can't take that long to study, she only had a week.
[2017/06/29, 17:18:57] Luc Hayward: I've looked at past papers they seem to focus on the immune system
[2017/06/29, 17:19:22] Stuart Mesham: Then I looked in the textbook and was like "no wonder I couldn't follow a single thing she was saying"
[2017/06/29, 17:19:48] Stuart Mesham: I just read through cell signalling once (that took ages) and hoped most of it sticked
[2017/06/29, 17:20:01] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/06/29, 17:20:11] Stuart Mesham: That "bio buzzwords" was a list of words I thought I'd forget
[2017/06/29, 17:57:38] Luc Hayward: Fucking going to murder terry
[2017/06/29, 18:09:28] Luc Hayward: At least Adam is quick other than photo

[2017/06/29, 20:21:35] Stuart Mesham: When you've been going for hours and you realize you're only half way through the powerpoint: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEkH9BF0sKw&t=51s
[2017/06/29, 20:22:35] Luc Hayward: Fucking live that video
[2017/06/29, 20:22:43] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😂
[2017/06/29, 20:22:58] Luc Hayward: What on earth are you still working on ?
[2017/06/29, 20:23:00] Stuart Mesham: I think I'm done for the day
[2017/06/29, 20:23:23] Stuart Mesham: No that was me at lunch time
[2017/06/29, 20:23:47] Luc Hayward: I haven't managed to learn glycolysis and citric acid cycle to the depth that you did.
[2017/06/29, 20:23:46] Stuart Mesham: I'm going to bed right now I can't take another slide
[2017/06/29, 20:24:11] Luc Hayward: Going to cram it a bit in the morning I think but hoping we fly through the tests and then you teach it to me 😂😂
[2017/06/29, 20:24:15] Luc Hayward: See you at 9:30
[2017/06/29, 20:24:40] Stuart Mesham: I haven't relearnt it in depth, I'm just hoping long term memory will come out of nowhere and everything will be fine 😇
[2017/06/29, 20:24:50] Luc Hayward: 🤷‍♂️🔫
[2017/06/29, 20:24:49] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😄
[2017/06/29, 20:25:01] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/06/29, 20:25:09] Stuart Mesham: ^^
[2017/06/29, 20:25:25] Stuart Mesham: This is the motto
[2017/06/30, 13:26:32] Stuart Mesham: See, study time 😄
[2017/06/30, 13:28:25] Luc Hayward: Exactly
[2017/06/30, 13:28:32] Luc Hayward: Do you have your student card
[2017/06/30, 13:30:51] Luc Hayward: Come as balls
[2017/06/30, 13:31:06] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/30, 13:31:15] Stuart Mesham: Oh you fool 😂
[2017/06/30, 13:31:26] Stuart Mesham: Do what Keegan did
[2017/06/30, 13:31:31] Stuart Mesham: Not sure what it was
[2017/06/30, 13:32:04] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/06/30, 17:16:57] Stuart Mesham: Take that bio (sort of)
[2017/06/30, 17:19:06] Luc Hayward: Fuck yes
[2017/06/30, 17:19:20] Luc Hayward: Also please tell me this didn't get an extra hour to write
[2017/06/30, 17:20:30] Stuart Mesham: I got half an hour
[2017/06/30, 17:20:39] Luc Hayward: Ask ok
[2017/06/30, 17:20:43] Luc Hayward: Ah
[2017/06/30, 17:20:59] Stuart Mesham: What a struggle
[2017/06/30, 17:21:32] Stuart Mesham: I "didn't finish" but when time ran out I didn't actually know anything else to write down 😂
[2017/06/30, 18:03:23] Luc Hayward: Stuart 😂 that's not not finishing that's just piss poor time management
[2017/06/30, 19:54:54] Stuart Mesham: Did you write answers for every single question???
[2017/06/30, 19:55:56] Stuart Mesham: I took one look at Terry's DNA question and then didn't take another 🙈
[2017/06/30, 21:07:41] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/06/30, 21:24:36] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/30, 21:25:23] Stuart Mesham: I spent way to long drawing theory of endosimiont pictures and ended up having to rush the rest of the long questions
[2017/06/30, 21:25:45] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/06/30, 21:26:03] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/06/30, 21:26:47] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/06/30, 21:27:07] Stuart Mesham: Oh well I left out the DNA thing but it was only out of so it's not that bad
[2017/06/30, 21:27:37] Stuart Mesham: Also I probably wouldn't have gotten many of the five anyway 😆
[2017/06/30, 21:27:39] Luc Hayward: Yeah it's fine we will have done fine
[2017/06/30, 21:27:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah overall it was fine
[2017/07/03, 08:09:55] Luc Hayward: Extra related rates lesson you coming?
[2017/07/03, 09:38:31] Stuart Mesham: Nah
[2017/07/03, 09:38:58] Stuart Mesham: I'll just rely on past papers for my related rates education
[2017/07/03, 09:49:13] Luc Hayward: I can't work at home today and there's no fucking parking at varsity
[2017/07/03, 10:39:44] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/03, 10:39:45] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/03, 10:40:01] Luc Hayward: Next semester. The dates are last year's dates but eh
[2017/07/03, 10:42:00] Stuart Mesham: Oh awesome thanks
[2017/07/03, 10:42:17] Stuart Mesham: Did you get those from Maria?
[2017/07/03, 10:43:40] Stuart Mesham: Gotta look up topics 6-10 😂
[2017/07/03, 11:21:48] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/07/03, 11:21:57] Luc Hayward: Do you have a nicer proof of the mvt
[2017/07/03, 11:22:25] Luc Hayward: Sipp is the so implications section I think
[2017/07/03, 11:22:42] Luc Hayward: Interfaces I've heard of
[2017/07/03, 11:23:02] Luc Hayward: Stacks and linked lists I know about but need to refresh their implementation
[2017/07/03, 11:27:45] Luc Hayward: Ok I think I figured it out. Where do we find the proof that a positive derivative implies a strictly increasing function though?
[2017/07/03, 11:27:51] Stuart Mesham: I just learnt the one from the resource book
[2017/07/03, 11:28:26] Stuart Mesham: I think that was in the resource book too
[2017/07/03, 11:28:40] Stuart Mesham: Either there or Jurie's notes
[2017/07/03, 11:28:43] Luc Hayward: Can you check for me? I can't find it
[2017/07/03, 11:28:51] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/07/03, 11:29:00] Luc Hayward: Thanks
[2017/07/03, 11:30:58] Stuart Mesham: Ah, Jurie's notes
[2017/07/03, 11:31:05] Stuart Mesham: 51 page 3
[2017/07/03, 11:31:37] Luc Hayward: 👌👌
[2017/07/03, 11:32:12] Luc Hayward: Have you collected your maths paper
[2017/07/03, 11:35:32] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/07/03, 11:35:37] Stuart Mesham: Are you there now?
[2017/07/03, 11:39:28] Luc Hayward: yeah. Your can collect yours on Thursday when we come in for bio and I’ll send you the answers to the multiple choice or you can go and look what your answers were in Dr Shock’s office and he will tell you where you went wrong
[2017/07/03, 11:40:29] Stuart Mesham: Can you collect mine now for me please? 🙏🏻
[2017/07/03, 11:40:52] Stuart Mesham: Is today the last day to collect them?
[2017/07/03, 11:41:16] Luc Hayward: No there's still test 1 lying there 😂
[2017/07/03, 11:41:34] Stuart Mesham: Oh 😂
[2017/07/03, 11:41:38] Luc Hayward: You can collect the test whenever and shock keeps our multiple choice but he will let you take a phoyo
[2017/07/03, 11:41:55] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool
[2017/07/03, 12:32:13] Stuart Mesham: Studying Maths folder on Quizlet: https://quizlet.com/Stuart_Mesham/folders/maths
[2017/07/03, 12:53:56] Luc Hayward: thanks
[2017/07/03, 13:13:32] Luc Hayward: We should also include important formulae
[2017/07/03, 13:13:47] Luc Hayward: I can't edit your lists though. 😂 you always keep them private
[2017/07/03, 14:14:40] Stuart Mesham: Can you add stuff to the folder?
[2017/07/03, 14:18:41] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/07/03, 14:21:19] Stuart Mesham: Ok try this: https://quizlet.com/join/H2TGKsW2f
[2017/07/03, 14:21:42] Luc Hayward: tht works
[2017/07/03, 14:21:45] Luc Hayward: 👍
[2017/07/03, 14:21:56] Luc Hayward: Have you been doing past papers, proofs or tuts?
[2017/07/03, 14:21:58] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool 👌🏻
[2017/07/03, 14:22:16] Stuart Mesham: I went through all the proofs once
[2017/07/03, 14:22:24] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/07/03, 14:22:27] Luc Hayward: and now?
[2017/07/03, 14:22:46] Stuart Mesham: Then I did 1 tut question on optimisation (the gutter one) and 1 on curve sketching
[2017/07/03, 14:22:54] Stuart Mesham: Then I did 2016 past paper
[2017/07/03, 14:23:02] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/07/03, 14:23:10] Luc Hayward: skipping the definite integral sections?
[2017/07/03, 14:23:21] Luc Hayward: ok I think I will change to doing past papers from tomorrow
[2017/07/03, 14:23:26] Stuart Mesham: Do we need to know those?
[2017/07/03, 14:23:33] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/07/03, 14:23:38] Stuart Mesham: What have you been doing?
[2017/07/03, 14:23:47] Luc Hayward: but we do need to know antierivatives which are essentially indefinite integrals
[2017/07/03, 14:23:51] Luc Hayward: went through the proofs
[2017/07/03, 14:24:09] Luc Hayward: struggling to get them to stick I think I need to write them out repeatedly
[2017/07/03, 14:24:17] Stuart Mesham: I semi procrastinated most of today making quizlets and then legit procrastinating on the internet
[2017/07/03, 14:24:18] Luc Hayward: been doing the tuts
[2017/07/03, 14:24:25] Luc Hayward: but they're like hours long each
[2017/07/03, 14:24:33] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/07/03, 14:24:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah same with the proofs
[2017/07/03, 14:28:11] Luc Hayward: I procratinated really hard yesterday though
[2017/07/03, 14:28:25] Luc Hayward: and this whole week is a fuck up for me I have nowhere to study
[2017/07/03, 14:28:46] Stuart Mesham: Oh ouch
[2017/07/03, 14:29:02] Stuart Mesham: Confined to the library?
[2017/07/03, 14:31:46] Luc Hayward: basically
[2017/07/03, 14:31:59] Luc Hayward: forgot to charge laptopl today so ive been in the mlc charging which was kak
[2017/07/03, 14:32:09] Luc Hayward: but yeah......its been crap
[2017/07/03, 14:32:23] Luc Hayward: hating life here
[2017/07/03, 14:37:03] Stuart Mesham: Oh my word that sounds awful
[2017/07/03, 14:39:57] Stuart Mesham: Hey do you want to come here?
[2017/07/03, 14:40:18] Luc Hayward: and study with you?
[2017/07/03, 14:40:44] Stuart Mesham: Yeah with me or just at my house
[2017/07/03, 14:41:14] Luc Hayward: yeah I might come though and study with you from tomorrow?
[2017/07/03, 14:41:29] Luc Hayward: That'd be cool and a lot easier than having to jammie to varsity everyday
[2017/07/03, 14:41:52] Stuart Mesham: Holy shit you've been jammying too 😂
[2017/07/03, 14:42:12] Luc Hayward: yeah there's no parking by the time i arrive at like 9
[2017/07/03, 14:42:17] Stuart Mesham: That's so rough 😂
[2017/07/03, 14:44:59] Luc Hayward: ye rough rough
[2017/07/03, 14:45:26] Luc Hayward: They're replacing the roof on part of the house
[2017/07/03, 14:48:19] Luc Hayward: anyway gonna go do 2016 past paper one shot now
[2017/07/03, 14:52:35] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/07/03, 14:53:17] Luc Hayward: But yeah if you're keen to study together then I'll come from tomorrow else I'll just tough it out at the library for this week 🙂
[2017/07/03, 14:55:00] Stuart Mesham: Sure, we can even just awkwardly sit next to each other and study independently 😄
[2017/07/03, 14:56:20] Luc Hayward: Basically just doing past papers and then tuts do it basically is just working through the party paper and asking each other if we get stuck ?
[2017/07/03, 14:57:00] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/03, 15:04:17] Luc Hayward: Ok if you're sure 👌👍👍
[2017/07/03, 15:04:21] Luc Hayward: Thanks
[2017/07/03, 15:20:53] Luc Hayward: Some of these are tough
[2017/07/03, 15:51:07] Luc Hayward: Ok mlc was a poor idea. Not doing that again
[2017/07/03, 16:07:52] Stuart Mesham: I can imagine 😄
[2017/07/03, 16:08:04] Stuart Mesham: It's so stuffy in there all the time
[2017/07/03, 16:14:39] Luc Hayward: And so loud with idiots
[2017/07/03, 16:14:56] Luc Hayward: So I'll see you tomorrow ?
[2017/07/03, 18:06:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah don't come before 9 though
[2017/07/03, 18:07:02] Stuart Mesham: I just won't let you
[2017/07/03, 18:07:07] Stuart Mesham: in
[2017/07/03, 18:07:23] Stuart Mesham: You can sit outside in your car until 9
[2017/07/03, 18:12:21] Stuart Mesham: Are you sure we have to know Σi³? (yes I put a lot of effort into that and I'm proud of it)
[2017/07/03, 18:12:42] Stuart Mesham: It wasn't in Jurie's notes
[2017/07/03, 18:46:08] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/03, 18:53:29] Luc Hayward: Yeah I have visas earlier in the day
[2017/07/03, 19:31:06] Luc Hayward: You don't have to know Riemann sums this time
[2017/07/03, 19:31:29] Luc Hayward: Oh weird
[2017/07/03, 19:32:01] Luc Hayward: It means f(x) to the power of g(x)
[2017/07/03, 19:53:38] Stuart Mesham: But then is it f(ln(g(x)))?
[2017/07/03, 19:53:55] Luc Hayward: Oh fuck
[2017/07/03, 19:53:57] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/07/03, 19:54:03] Luc Hayward: F times ln g
[2017/07/04, 09:56:19] Luc Hayward: Yo half an hour ? You eat steers?
[2017/07/04, 10:24:07] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/04, 10:24:15] Stuart Mesham: What? 😂
[2017/07/04, 10:26:54] Luc Hayward: Too late
[2017/07/04, 10:45:09] Luc Hayward: It's actually easy.  Just copy and paste this:

Run *cc* on it and then just ./a.out.  (Granted you may have to find an older C compiler, but this is fully-functioning Tetris.)
[2017/07/05, 09:22:21] Stuart Mesham: I'm finished showering and stuff 👍🏻
[2017/07/05, 09:55:03] Luc Hayward: 30 min
[2017/07/05, 10:00:18] Luc Hayward: To
[2017/07/05, 10:00:29] Luc Hayward: You want some mc Donald's
[2017/07/05, 10:00:57] Stuart Mesham: Nah good thanks
[2017/07/05, 10:02:17] Luc Hayward: K
[2017/07/06, 07:43:35] Luc Hayward: You up?
[2017/07/06, 07:43:47] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/06, 08:58:15] Luc Hayward: 15 min
[2017/07/06, 09:22:02] Luc Hayward: Dropped pin near 12 Dreyer St, Claremont, Cape Town, 7708
https://goo.gl/maps/K2ZmyMrWzqP2
[2017/07/06, 10:42:45] Stuart Mesham: http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mythhandclasp.html
[2017/07/06, 13:46:56] Luc Hayward: Message me when you get out
[2017/07/06, 14:20:40] Luc Hayward: Yo
[2017/07/06, 14:20:46] Luc Hayward: You still can't be writing
[2017/07/06, 14:31:56] Luc Hayward: Mesham
[2017/07/06, 14:31:58] Luc Hayward: Stu
[2017/07/06, 14:31:59] Luc Hayward: Stuart
[2017/07/06, 14:37:00] Luc Hayward: Mesham
[2017/07/06, 14:37:02] Luc Hayward: Stu
[2017/07/06, 14:37:04] Luc Hayward: Stuart
[2017/07/06, 14:37:18] Stuart Mesham: What what what
[2017/07/06, 14:37:27] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm out
[2017/07/06, 14:38:00] Luc Hayward: Did you start late?
[2017/07/06, 14:38:17] Stuart Mesham: Sorry, I think I pushed the wrong button
[2017/07/06, 14:38:34] Luc Hayward: You write for an extra hour nearly
[2017/07/06, 14:38:35] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it was terrible 😂
[2017/07/06, 14:39:13] Stuart Mesham: We waited outside the wrong place and missed the first 15 minutes of our exam
[2017/07/06, 14:39:22] Luc Hayward: Wow
[2017/07/06, 14:39:25] Stuart Mesham: Luckily it wasn't such a long exam
[2017/07/06, 14:39:33] Stuart Mesham: So I still finished
[2017/07/06, 14:39:50] Stuart Mesham: Are you desperate to escape Cavendish?
[2017/07/06, 14:39:56] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/07/06, 14:40:09] Luc Hayward: I'll meet you at the pin just call when you get there
[2017/07/06, 14:40:18] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/07/06, 14:40:20] Luc Hayward: My phones dying though 😂 but you'll see me
[2017/07/06, 14:40:28] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/07/06, 14:46:36] Luc Hayward: The pin is dropped near tigers milk
[2017/07/06, 16:20:08] Stuart Mesham: I wanna 7zip my bio folder too now
[2017/07/06, 16:20:21] Stuart Mesham: It'll give me a sense of completion 😄
[2017/07/06, 18:37:35] Luc Hayward: definitely should
[2017/07/06, 19:06:30] Luc Hayward: you know netbeans can run c++,C,python and java ?
[2017/07/06, 19:07:34] Stuart Mesham: Stop reading the Java textbook!!
[2017/07/06, 19:07:55] Stuart Mesham: But I didn't know that 🤔
[2017/07/06, 19:08:25] Luc Hayward: I'm not !! 😂
[2017/07/06, 19:08:42] Luc Hayward: Im not studying now
[2017/07/06, 19:08:50] Stuart Mesham: Neither
[2017/07/06, 19:08:55] Stuart Mesham: I want to be
[2017/07/06, 19:09:31] Stuart Mesham: But my eyes are sore from reading too many arbitrary websites/blog posts so I can't 😂
[2017/07/06, 19:11:05] Stuart Mesham: This was the last one: https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2016/12/09/developers-side-projects/
[2017/07/06, 19:11:19] Stuart Mesham: Though I'm not saying you should read it
[2017/07/06, 19:12:31] Stuart Mesham: It's not that exciting
[2017/07/06, 19:44:08] Luc Hayward: I know about this
[2017/07/06, 19:44:17] Luc Hayward: It's in silicon valley even
[2017/07/06, 21:01:51] Stuart Mesham: It is??
[2017/07/06, 21:01:59] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah the court case
[2017/07/06, 21:02:14] Stuart Mesham: When they have to prove that Richard has a girlfriend 😂
[2017/07/06, 21:12:12] Luc Hayward: No the one with bighead
[2017/07/07, 09:28:34] Luc Hayward: See you 10
[2017/07/07, 09:28:39] Luc Hayward: Min
[2017/07/07, 09:29:04] Stuart Mesham: K
[2017/07/07, 13:30:58] Luc Hayward: You find the place?
[2017/07/07, 13:43:12] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it's the same place as yesterday
[2017/07/07, 16:11:30] Luc Hayward: Tell me when you get out
[2017/07/07, 16:11:52] Luc Hayward: Will tell you if I am coming with you or if my friend lifted me
[2017/07/07, 16:39:47] Stuart Mesham: Where you at?
[2017/07/07, 16:40:01] Stuart Mesham: I'm out
[2017/07/07, 19:10:48] Luc Hayward: Ay
[2017/07/07, 19:20:19] Luc Hayward: You working hard af tomorrow ? Or time for a short break possibly
[2017/07/07, 21:39:26] Stuart Mesham: I'll wake up late, try work from 10 to 5 and then chill in the evening
[2017/07/07, 21:40:08] Stuart Mesham: 10 to 5 allows for an hour or two of the inevitable procrastination
[2017/07/07, 21:40:23] Stuart Mesham: And food
[2017/07/07, 21:40:57] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/07/07, 21:41:02] Luc Hayward: My WiFi is dead
[2017/07/07, 21:41:15] Luc Hayward: Might need a quick spot of help with fiagnosis
[2017/07/07, 21:41:48] Luc Hayward: Current theory is that the roof guys torched my cabling when they were doing the water proofing.
[2017/07/07, 21:41:49] Stuart Mesham: How exactly am I going to help fix it from here 😂
[2017/07/07, 21:41:58] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/07/07, 21:42:00] Luc Hayward: Testing tomorrow using a phone from the office
[2017/07/07, 21:42:16] Luc Hayward: If I get a line, I test with a new phone cable.
[2017/07/07, 21:42:31] Stuart Mesham: What cable?
[2017/07/07, 21:42:50] Stuart Mesham: Is the phone line gone too?
[2017/07/07, 21:43:03] Luc Hayward: The little brown cable yeah that one
[2017/07/07, 21:43:07] Luc Hayward: I dunno
[2017/07/07, 21:43:16] Luc Hayward: Bringing a phone home with a new cable tomorrow.
[2017/07/07, 21:43:27] Luc Hayward: If the phone line runs then that's goid
[2017/07/07, 21:45:16] Luc Hayward: If it doesn't dial out then they torched the lines and I call Telkom
[2017/07/07, 21:45:35] Luc Hayward: If it does dial out but a new cable doesn't work, I need to test my modem
[2017/07/07, 21:45:52] Luc Hayward: Do you want to offer up your line to test it ?
[2017/07/07, 21:47:05] Luc Hayward: Literally would just need to swing by, plug my modem in and see if it recognises that it's plugged in
[2017/07/07, 21:47:00] Stuart Mesham: Don't you have any landline phones?
[2017/07/07, 21:48:21] Luc Hayward: If it's a problem though I'll find another way to diagnose the problem.
[2017/07/07, 21:48:54] Stuart Mesham: Sure 👍🏻
[2017/07/07, 21:52:38] Luc Hayward: No. I'm bringing one from the office. But if it dials out and I still can't get my modems to recognise that they're plugged in (diagnostics just say no line is connected). Which means either something inside the house is broken or my modem has given up the ghost.
[2017/07/07, 21:52:51] Luc Hayward: But I'll message you tomorrow, is that ok ?
[2017/07/07, 21:59:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah, chat tomorrow
[2017/07/08, 10:02:49] Luc Hayward: Ok don't need to swing by you
[2017/07/08, 10:03:04] Luc Hayward: My builders melted my cabling there's no power on the lines at all
[2017/07/08, 12:45:45] Stuart Mesham: Ah ok
[2017/07/08, 12:48:29] Stuart Mesham: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6lu1vx/What_is_the_smallest_amount_of_power_you%27ve_ever_seen_someone_abuse%3F/djwnzrs/
[2017/07/08, 12:48:48] Luc Hayward: Saw it.
[2017/07/08, 12:49:05] Luc Hayward: 😂👌👌
[2017/07/08, 12:49:14] Stuart Mesham: You saw that exact comment already!? 😂
[2017/07/08, 12:49:30] Luc Hayward: I read like half the thread last night
[2017/07/08, 12:49:43] Stuart Mesham: Ah same 🙈😂
[2017/07/08, 12:51:55] Luc Hayward: So bleak about my WiFi situation
[2017/07/08, 12:52:17] Luc Hayward: Could take till Monday to get a response
[2017/07/08, 13:07:50] Luc Hayward: I'm starting a quizlet on definitions but I don't have all the notes on me and no WiFi so if I miss any please fill them in
[2017/07/08, 13:33:38] Luc Hayward: Password is 1234
I am currently studying Chemistry definitions 1st semester on Quizlet
https://quizlet.com/215762001/chemistry-definitions-1st-semester-flash-cards/
[2017/07/08, 14:09:11] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/07/08, 14:10:04] Stuart Mesham: The organic chemistry textbook just taught me stuff I honestly didn't have a clue about this whole semester for naming molecules
[2017/07/08, 14:10:22] Stuart Mesham: Go right to the start of the naming molecules section
[2017/07/08, 14:10:35] Stuart Mesham: I think it's around page 52 or something
[2017/07/08, 14:11:04] Stuart Mesham: It explains all the "isopropyl" stuff that Sunny never explained to us
[2017/07/08, 14:14:30] Stuart Mesham: Also the "sec-butyl" and "tert-butyl" names
[2017/07/08, 14:24:47] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/07/08, 15:31:52] Luc Hayward: Ugh some of this is so simple and other parts are...... Organic
[2017/07/08, 15:32:48] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/08, 15:35:38] Luc Hayward: I'm good with everything except the last lecture on sunny. And then some of the stuff on partial pressures. And oh also tinothy Eagan I need to double check how to do the whole drawing section
[2017/07/08, 15:36:31] Luc Hayward: How much are you planning to do today and tomorrow? Are you good for me to come through again this week ? Or are you busy
[2017/07/08, 16:09:48] Stuart Mesham: Yeah you can come this week (will probably be better to be able to discuss/figure out the organic chemistry together anyway 😵)
[2017/07/08, 16:10:44] Stuart Mesham: I'm struggling with motivation today but I'm gonna try do as much as my attention span allows for
[2017/07/08, 16:10:56] Stuart Mesham: I'll probably do the same tomorrow
[2017/07/08, 16:12:05] Stuart Mesham: Do you happen to know why Al(OH)₃ is insoluble?
[2017/07/08, 16:12:18] Luc Hayward: Yeah and when going through past papers much easier to just run through and make sure we know how to do it, the basic calculations can probably be glossed over
[2017/07/08, 16:12:35] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/08, 16:13:17] Luc Hayward: Same 😂 maths was draining. I'm thinking that by the end of tomorrow we need to have finished going over notes and past tutorials and be ready to get stuck into past papers at the very least.
[2017/07/08, 16:13:34] Luc Hayward: Insoluble in what?
[2017/07/08, 16:13:44] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/08, 16:13:50] Stuart Mesham: Just insoluble
[2017/07/08, 16:14:02] Stuart Mesham: I think it means in water?
[2017/07/08, 16:14:08] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/08, 16:14:22] Luc Hayward: Solubility table says OH groups are insoluble in water
[2017/07/08, 16:14:23] Stuart Mesham: They only give us one set of solubility rules as far as I know
[2017/07/08, 16:14:48] Luc Hayward: I'm finished up to tut 4 and am halfway through the notes maybe
[2017/07/08, 16:14:55] Luc Hayward: Yeah that set
[2017/07/08, 16:15:00] Stuart Mesham: Oh my word I'm so stupid I forgot the bottom section meant insoluble 😂
[2017/07/08, 16:15:10] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/08, 16:15:22] Stuart Mesham: I was like "but aluminium isn't in groups 1 or 2"
[2017/07/08, 16:15:38] Luc Hayward: Yeah😂
[2017/07/08, 16:15:51] Stuart Mesham: I've got a printed one from one of our tests 😎
[2017/07/08, 16:16:04] Luc Hayward: 👌
[2017/07/08, 16:16:07] Stuart Mesham: All of the pages of the formula sheet _in ink_ 😎
[2017/07/08, 16:16:08] Luc Hayward: Well that's what we get
[2017/07/08, 16:16:19] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/07/08, 16:16:42] Luc Hayward: FEels as though tomorrow is Monday
[2017/07/08, 16:17:45] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it does somehow
[2017/07/08, 16:17:58] Luc Hayward: So weird.
[2017/07/08, 16:18:22] Stuart Mesham: It probably means I'm not going to do much on Sunday
[2017/07/08, 16:18:34] Luc Hayward: Monday will be swat day
[2017/07/08, 16:18:43] Stuart Mesham: So I'm thinking like study wise tomorrow is monday 😄
[2017/07/08, 16:18:47] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/08, 16:19:05] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/07/08, 16:37:49] Luc Hayward: Waste your day
[2017/07/08, 16:38:19] Luc Hayward: www.fullgames.sk/fullgame/39001/super-truck.htm
[2017/07/08, 16:38:21] Luc Hayward: Go
[2017/07/08, 16:54:34] Stuart Mesham: 😂😂 is it from the same people?
[2017/07/08, 16:58:22] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/07/08, 16:58:32] Luc Hayward: Actually no
[2017/07/08, 16:58:34] Luc Hayward: Might not be
[2017/07/08, 16:59:11] Luc Hayward: Is made by landfall
[2017/07/08, 16:59:18] Luc Hayward: They also did ultimate battle simulator
[2017/07/08, 16:59:35] Luc Hayward: No they were totally accurate battle sim
[2017/07/08, 16:59:38] Stuart Mesham: It does look like quite a jol
[2017/07/08, 17:00:07] Luc Hayward: SQuare brawl is another nice game of theirs
[2017/07/08, 17:00:28] Stuart Mesham: And clustertruck?
[2017/07/08, 17:00:51] Luc Hayward: Cluster truck is them. It was just a little jam game that they turned into a full release
[2017/07/08, 17:01:03] Luc Hayward: Very fun.
[2017/07/08, 17:01:27] Stuart Mesham: I have to try all of these things but I need to do chemistry as well 😂
[2017/07/08, 17:02:25] Luc Hayward: All physics based in unity so sometimes it is possible to have a level be unwinnable but not normally (unity physics is nondeterministic which means that the same input won't always provide the same output so sometimes the physics line up in such a way as to make the end impossible to reach and you restart the level)
[2017/07/08, 17:02:35] Luc Hayward: It's 5 you weren't going to do more work anyway
[2017/07/08, 17:04:07] Stuart Mesham: This will drive me crazy 😄
[2017/07/08, 17:07:36] Luc Hayward: It honestly doesn't normally happen
[2017/07/08, 17:07:57] Luc Hayward: Like physics is still physics and still behaves normally 99.99% of the time
[2017/07/08, 17:08:09] Luc Hayward: And the times that it does fuck up, it's probably your fault
[2017/07/08, 17:29:23] Stuart Mesham: But the 1% of times when I don't fail is important 😄
[2017/07/08, 17:59:28] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/07/09, 10:42:44] Luc Hayward: Really struggling here to work out when to use a prefix name or a suffix name
[2017/07/09, 10:53:40] Luc Hayward: And for instance when is something methyl alcohol vs mthenol
[2017/07/09, 11:10:00] Stuart Mesham: Methyl alcohol is the common name and methanol is the systematic name
[2017/07/09, 11:10:16] Luc Hayward: Which do I write down
[2017/07/09, 11:10:28] Luc Hayward: I write down methanol right?
[2017/07/09, 11:10:40] Stuart Mesham: So both of them would be right unless they ask specifically for systematic
[2017/07/09, 11:10:42] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/09, 11:11:40] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/07/09, 11:11:55] Luc Hayward: And then how do I know whether to use the suffix or three prefix
[2017/07/09, 11:11:57] Luc Hayward: The
[2017/07/09, 11:12:02] Luc Hayward: Not three
[2017/07/09, 11:15:51] Stuart Mesham: What's the prefix?
[2017/07/09, 11:19:53] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 11:20:42] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/07/09, 11:21:02] Stuart Mesham: I think if it's a substituent group then it's the prefix
[2017/07/09, 11:21:35] Stuart Mesham: Like I'm guessing you could have 2-carboxyl-heptane
[2017/07/09, 11:21:45] Stuart Mesham: Without the second dash
[2017/07/09, 11:21:59] Stuart Mesham: *2-carboxylheptane
[2017/07/09, 11:22:07] Stuart Mesham: I think
[2017/07/09, 11:22:22] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait no
[2017/07/09, 11:22:28] Luc Hayward: Substituent group ? Ok right
[2017/07/09, 11:22:33] Stuart Mesham: Then it wouldn't be heptane
[2017/07/09, 11:22:38] Luc Hayward: Some of this shit is so contradictory though
[2017/07/09, 11:22:42] Stuart Mesham: I think so
[2017/07/09, 11:23:01] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it's organic chemistry who knows 😂
[2017/07/09, 11:23:46] Stuart Mesham: We don't need to know these off by heart though do we?
[2017/07/09, 11:24:30] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/07/09, 11:24:44] Stuart Mesham: Good 😅
[2017/07/09, 11:24:50] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 11:25:39] Stuart Mesham: Yeah so in C-C they are both primary
[2017/07/09, 11:25:53] Stuart Mesham: And C-C-C the middle is secondary
[2017/07/09, 11:27:25] Stuart Mesham: C
C-C
C

The one on the left in the middle row is tertiary
[2017/07/09, 11:27:40] Stuart Mesham: And I think that's all we need to know
[2017/07/09, 11:28:12] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 11:28:15] Luc Hayward: Not following how this works
[2017/07/09, 11:28:57] Stuart Mesham: It's because the one on the left in the middle row is bonded to 3 others
[2017/07/09, 11:29:58] Stuart Mesham: You count the number of carbons it is directly bonded to (excluding itself)
[2017/07/09, 11:30:33] Luc Hayward: The isobutyl and the sec butyl look the same to me ? They're both on secondary carbons
[2017/07/09, 11:30:59] Stuart Mesham: But if you look at the highlighted carbon
[2017/07/09, 11:31:32] Luc Hayward: But why is that one highlighted
[2017/07/09, 11:32:05] Stuart Mesham: Because that's the one that connects to the other thing
[2017/07/09, 11:32:20] Luc Hayward: Oh ok
[2017/07/09, 11:32:47] Stuart Mesham: Like if it's isobutyl bromide then the Br will be bonded to the highlighted carbon
[2017/07/09, 11:33:02] Luc Hayward: Ok think I got it
[2017/07/09, 11:33:09] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/07/09, 11:33:24] Luc Hayward: If I don't, you can try again in person
[2017/07/09, 11:33:37] Stuart Mesham: Ok 👍🏻😄
[2017/07/09, 11:36:25] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 11:36:25] Luc Hayward: Like this I know I'll forget and try to write it as 2-bromopropane
[2017/07/09, 11:37:25] Luc Hayward: Actually I think both are correct
[2017/07/09, 11:38:45] Stuart Mesham: I think 2 bromopropane is the correct systematic name
[2017/07/09, 11:39:13] Luc Hayward: And the other is the common name
[2017/07/09, 11:39:15] Luc Hayward: Makes sense
[2017/07/09, 11:39:18] Stuart Mesham: All the names in red (in the textbook) are the common names and all the blue names are the systematic names
[2017/07/09, 11:43:47] Luc Hayward: This textbook so just infinitely better to learn organic chemistry from than his notes
[2017/07/09, 11:49:17] Stuart Mesham: Right? 😂
[2017/07/09, 11:49:39] Stuart Mesham: The notes are so hard to understand
[2017/07/09, 11:54:34] Luc Hayward: Please remind me what if my cycloalkane is smaller than my lccc
[2017/07/09, 11:55:08] Stuart Mesham: What?
[2017/07/09, 11:55:31] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 11:56:19] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 11:56:37] Stuart Mesham: I don't know
[2017/07/09, 11:56:48] Stuart Mesham: Try google the names it could have
[2017/07/09, 11:57:28] Luc Hayward: I'm pretty certain that it isn't pentylcyclopropane
[2017/07/09, 11:57:39] Luc Hayward: I have little internet haha
[2017/07/09, 11:57:55] Stuart Mesham: It would be cyclobutane wouldn't it?
[2017/07/09, 11:58:08] Luc Hayward: That's what I meant
[2017/07/09, 11:58:12] Luc Hayward: Cyclobutane
[2017/07/09, 11:59:14] Luc Hayward: It's 1-cyclobutylpentane apparently
[2017/07/09, 11:59:34] Stuart Mesham: Butylcyclobutane is a thing
[2017/07/09, 12:02:49] Stuart Mesham: So if the cycloalkane length is >= the other LCCC then you choose the cycloalkane
[2017/07/09, 12:03:05] Stuart Mesham: Otherwise it's a substituent group
[2017/07/09, 12:03:28] Stuart Mesham: At least I think
[2017/07/09, 12:04:05] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/07/09, 12:04:23] Luc Hayward: Cycloalknes take preference until the lccc is bigger
[2017/07/09, 12:04:37] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/09, 12:06:16] Luc Hayward: We don't learn boiling points right?
[2017/07/09, 12:06:51] Stuart Mesham: I don't know, will have to check the past papers
[2017/07/09, 12:30:32] Luc Hayward: Don't think so
[2017/07/09, 12:45:56] Stuart Mesham: Sorry for the distraction but: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/
[2017/07/09, 12:46:09] Stuart Mesham: They might give all their stuff to use for free!
[2017/07/09, 12:46:15] Stuart Mesham: *to us
[2017/07/09, 12:46:36] Luc Hayward: You reading the textbook again ??
[2017/07/09, 12:46:49] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/07/09, 12:47:48] Luc Hayward: Also why learn an ide and then have it taken away from you again ?
[2017/07/09, 12:47:57] Luc Hayward: Still may as well apply
[2017/07/09, 12:48:16] Stuart Mesham: But you can have intellij ultimate for your own java projects
[2017/07/09, 12:48:19] Stuart Mesham: And pycharm
[2017/07/09, 12:48:23] Stuart Mesham: And phpstorm
[2017/07/09, 12:48:40] Luc Hayward: Can also have netbeans for that? And pychsrm is free
[2017/07/09, 12:48:59] Stuart Mesham: Not the _professional_ one
[2017/07/09, 12:49:11] Luc Hayward: Oh really ?
[2017/07/09, 12:49:11] Stuart Mesham: Intellij is so much better than netbeans though
[2017/07/09, 12:49:27] Stuart Mesham: Netbeans vs interlij is like swing vs javafx
[2017/07/09, 12:49:36] Stuart Mesham: interlij is just better in every way
[2017/07/09, 12:49:46] Luc Hayward: HVe you used it ?
[2017/07/09, 12:49:57] Stuart Mesham: I've used it in android studio
[2017/07/09, 12:50:02] Luc Hayward: Signed up.
[2017/07/09, 12:50:05] Stuart Mesham: And in pycharm
[2017/07/09, 12:50:30] Stuart Mesham: They use the same base ide framework or something across all their ides
[2017/07/09, 12:50:31] Luc Hayward: Why would you have used intellij in pycharm
[2017/07/09, 12:50:37] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/07/09, 12:50:55] Stuart Mesham: Their autocompleting is the greatest thing ever
[2017/07/09, 12:51:18] Stuart Mesham: Once you try it you can never go back unless you have to write a compsci test
[2017/07/09, 12:51:24] Luc Hayward: I'm sure it's not any better than visual studio (although I guess youve never tried vs)
[2017/07/09, 12:52:00] Stuart Mesham: I've never tried visual studio but intellij's autocompleting is _so_ good
[2017/07/09, 12:52:14] Stuart Mesham: Like _so so so_ good
[2017/07/09, 12:54:56] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 12:55:32] Stuart Mesham: Yaaay
[2017/07/09, 12:55:48] Stuart Mesham: Free intelli-everything!
[2017/07/09, 12:56:44] Luc Hayward: You should honestly be using visual studio on the beast. There definitely isn't a better ide on windows for C,C++,VB.net, c#
[2017/07/09, 12:57:22] Stuart Mesham: I don't use any of those languages though 😂
[2017/07/09, 12:57:50] Stuart Mesham: And the jetbrains ides aren't even for those
[2017/07/09, 12:57:53] Luc Hayward: Actually other than Java I don't know anything that you couldn't use VS for
[2017/07/09, 12:58:22] Stuart Mesham: Other than Java though
[2017/07/09, 12:58:30] Stuart Mesham: That's a big one 😂
[2017/07/09, 12:59:08] Luc Hayward: Pretty sure Microsoft just pulls a giant fuck you to Java most says
[2017/07/09, 12:59:11] Luc Hayward: Which makes sense
[2017/07/09, 12:59:20] Luc Hayward: Because they want you to work in C#
[2017/07/09, 12:59:24] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/09, 13:00:19] Luc Hayward: Actually I lie vs can support java
[2017/07/09, 13:00:32] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok
[2017/07/09, 13:00:54] Stuart Mesham: I still want to use intellij though
[2017/07/09, 13:01:10] Luc Hayward: No maybe not
[2017/07/09, 13:01:12] Luc Hayward: 🤷‍♂️
[2017/07/09, 13:02:04] Stuart Mesham: It probably "supports" Java in that you can make the compile and run button work but not in the codey stuff
[2017/07/09, 13:02:22] Stuart Mesham: Like "supports" but not really
[2017/07/09, 13:02:42] Stuart Mesham: Because I'd imagine this would be the case
[2017/07/09, 13:02:51] Luc Hayward: But yeah you should take a look at it
[2017/07/09, 13:03:29] Luc Hayward: There's sorta vs for Mac but it's basically just Microsoft's acquisition of another company
[2017/07/09, 13:03:31] Stuart Mesham: Also packaging into jars and stuff like that
[2017/07/09, 13:03:58] Stuart Mesham: Yeah haven't looked into that yet
[2017/07/09, 13:04:23] Luc Hayward: www.visualstudio.com/vs/
[2017/07/09, 13:04:57] Stuart Mesham: Ok not now though, I need to end this microsleep
[2017/07/09, 13:05:07] Stuart Mesham: That's for the next one
[2017/07/09, 13:13:31] Luc Hayward: Fuck I love being a student
[2017/07/09, 13:13:45] Stuart Mesham: Intellij also make Visual Studio plugins so not sure what those are about
[2017/07/09, 13:13:54] Luc Hayward: Yeah it's weird
[2017/07/09, 13:13:54] Stuart Mesham: Same 😂
[2017/07/09, 13:14:23] Stuart Mesham: Also phpstorm I've used and it's absolutely brilliant
[2017/07/09, 13:14:38] Stuart Mesham: Except I used it with a fake license 🙈
[2017/07/09, 13:15:00] Stuart Mesham: At least I can have a legit one now 😄
[2017/07/09, 13:15:32] Luc Hayward: Basically because it makes no sense to learn 10 ides so rather learn one or two and have them setup nicely for you
[2017/07/09, 13:16:05] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/09, 13:16:40] Luc Hayward: We only get one year
[2017/07/09, 13:16:49] Stuart Mesham: But if you've unknowingly learnt one that's not as good as the other's (NetBeans) then I think it makes sense to change if the others are significantly better
[2017/07/09, 13:17:01] Luc Hayward: Yeah yeah no true
[2017/07/09, 13:17:05] Stuart Mesham: I reckon we'll be able to just renew it
[2017/07/09, 13:17:32] Stuart Mesham: As long as we still have our UCT emails
[2017/07/09, 13:17:46] Luc Hayward: Like netbeans is great. Like really netbeans is fantastic, it's just that the paid one is better obviously
[2017/07/09, 13:18:42] Stuart Mesham: Yeah, but like you'll see using NetBeans feels rough after you've used the intellisense autocomplete
[2017/07/09, 13:19:28] Luc Hayward: But you should really try visual studio for mac (or even VSCode which is a super lightweight thing. Basically a text editor with some helpful plugins). I think you'll find its much much nicer to use than the standard monodevelop if you set it up right.
[2017/07/09, 13:19:38] Luc Hayward: Cus then you can use that for unity and C#
[2017/07/09, 13:19:55] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I hate monodevelop on unity 😂
[2017/07/09, 13:20:06] Stuart Mesham: Will definitely give that a try
[2017/07/09, 13:20:27] Luc Hayward: And then jetbrains provides intelliJ, pycharm, phostorm and technically provides C++ stuff though I'd probably stick with VS
[2017/07/09, 13:20:53] Luc Hayward: Nice thing is as you say most of these are built on the same framework so hopefully your settings are easily transferable
[2017/07/09, 13:20:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah same
[2017/07/09, 13:22:37] Stuart Mesham: Yeah like the official Google-supplied Android studio actually uses the framework made by jetbrains so I think they did first develop some sort of general purpose thing and then make ides tailored to specific languages with it
[2017/07/09, 13:23:27] Stuart Mesham: So even across different languages the IDEs are probably extremely similar
[2017/07/09, 13:23:30] Luc Hayward: Right.
[2017/07/09, 13:23:45] Luc Hayward: Didn't realise android studio was required?
[2017/07/09, 13:24:32] Stuart Mesham: It has nice android specific stuff built into it which you could've manually installed on your own IDE but mission
[2017/07/09, 13:24:54] Stuart Mesham: So it's not _actually_ required
[2017/07/09, 13:25:17] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/07/09, 13:25:29] Luc Hayward: I don't think I'll be using app code over xcode though
[2017/07/09, 13:25:46] Stuart Mesham: Oh no I wouldn't either
[2017/07/09, 13:26:05] Stuart Mesham: Not iOS stuff
[2017/07/09, 13:26:33] Luc Hayward: Ok yeah so we renew every year
[2017/07/09, 13:26:45] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/09, 13:27:01] Stuart Mesham: It's great being a student 😂
[2017/07/09, 13:28:21] Luc Hayward: Micro sleep over
[2017/07/09, 13:28:24] Luc Hayward: Back to work
[2017/07/09, 13:49:35] Luc Hayward: So happy we don't have to do this
[2017/07/09, 13:49:39] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 14:01:38] Stuart Mesham: Yes thank goodness!
[2017/07/09, 14:02:03] Luc Hayward: What have you done today
[2017/07/09, 14:03:01] Stuart Mesham: Well I only woke up at 10 so I've done breakfast, solubility reactions, some organic chemistry textbook reading and lunch 😄
[2017/07/09, 14:03:20] Luc Hayward: We don't have to know about addition of water to any of this stuff right?
[2017/07/09, 14:03:39] Luc Hayward: Ok good so we're both on track to start past papers tomorrow?
[2017/07/09, 14:03:45] Luc Hayward: Oh what time am I arriving ?
[2017/07/09, 14:04:21] Stuart Mesham: Yeah did you find anything unexpected about drawing the shape of molecules/ pi bonds etc.?
[2017/07/09, 14:04:34] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/07/09, 14:04:42] Stuart Mesham: Same as usual, just don't arrive before 9
[2017/07/09, 14:04:47] Luc Hayward: But I'm going to go over it again after organic chemostry
[2017/07/09, 14:04:50] Luc Hayward: Ok cool thing
[2017/07/09, 14:05:25] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'll just finish off the textbook reading and then see if I can do that last tut
[2017/07/09, 14:05:41] Luc Hayward: Last tut ? Tut ten?
[2017/07/09, 14:05:46] Luc Hayward: Greg's tut ?
[2017/07/09, 14:05:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/09, 14:06:02] Luc Hayward: The one we did a test on ?
[2017/07/09, 14:06:04] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/07/09, 14:06:08] Stuart Mesham: Sunny's one
[2017/07/09, 14:06:32] Stuart Mesham: The one that I googled half the answers, wrote them down and still didn't understand them 😂
[2017/07/09, 14:30:28] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/07/09, 14:30:33] Luc Hayward: Which number?
[2017/07/09, 14:31:06] Stuart Mesham: Dunno, will tell you later
[2017/07/09, 14:37:14] Luc Hayward: It's at the top??
[2017/07/09, 14:39:56] Stuart Mesham: 8 and 9
[2017/07/09, 14:41:47] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/07/09, 14:41:55] Luc Hayward: Center or centre what do you use
[2017/07/09, 14:48:12] Stuart Mesham: Centre?
[2017/07/09, 14:48:27] Stuart Mesham: I think I use centre 😂
[2017/07/09, 14:48:33] Luc Hayward: That's what I said
[2017/07/09, 14:48:41] Luc Hayward: But the internet disagrees sometimes
[2017/07/09, 14:48:56] Stuart Mesham: You'd have to catch me while I'm not concentrating on it, I can't think which one I normally use 😂
[2017/07/09, 14:49:05] Luc Hayward: 😂🤷‍♂️
[2017/07/09, 14:49:26] Stuart Mesham: Wikipedia says centre
[2017/07/09, 14:49:59] Stuart Mesham: Oh but it also says center 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/07/09, 14:50:30] Luc Hayward: And our bio exam said center
[2017/07/09, 14:54:48] Stuart Mesham: Oh no, I don't want to be wrong
[2017/07/09, 14:55:27] Luc Hayward: One is American they can't tell you you're wrong else they're disrespecting your culture
[2017/07/09, 14:56:12] Stuart Mesham: Are we the American ones?
[2017/07/09, 14:59:36] Luc Hayward: Not a clue
[2017/07/09, 14:59:39] Luc Hayward: Normally no
[2017/07/09, 14:59:56] Luc Hayward: Do we do multiple chiral centres ?
[2017/07/09, 16:00:52] Luc Hayward: In confused
[2017/07/09, 16:02:00] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 16:05:44] Stuart Mesham: I don't know about the green symbol but the printed one is definitely a benzene ring
[2017/07/09, 16:09:27] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 16:09:47] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 16:10:05] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 16:10:13] Stuart Mesham: From here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_compound
[2017/07/09, 16:10:44] Stuart Mesham: Which notes are those?
[2017/07/09, 16:12:34] Luc Hayward: Back pages of alkanes alkanes and benzenees
[2017/07/09, 16:12:38] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 16:13:21] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 16:14:37] Stuart Mesham: What does Me stand for?
[2017/07/09, 16:15:55] Luc Hayward: Not a fucking clue
[2017/07/09, 16:17:38] Luc Hayward: Maybe methyl
[2017/07/09, 16:17:59] Luc Hayward: Because that is a real thing then
[2017/07/09, 16:19:38] Stuart Mesham: Oh the ring with an OH at the bottom is called phenol
[2017/07/09, 16:19:48] Stuart Mesham: I just learnt something new
[2017/07/09, 16:20:05] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 16:21:08] Stuart Mesham: The site I'm looking at says touline but maybe that's just a common name
[2017/07/09, 16:21:49] Stuart Mesham: The top of the slide seems to imply that you can just make benzene the suffix and call it methylbenzene
[2017/07/09, 16:22:44] Luc Hayward: That's true
[2017/07/09, 16:22:55] Luc Hayward: But the textbook agrees here
[2017/07/09, 16:23:06] Stuart Mesham: Page?
[2017/07/09, 16:25:21] Luc Hayward: 216
[2017/07/09, 16:28:57] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/07/09, 16:29:09] Stuart Mesham: 4 follow the rule and 8 are exceptions
[2017/07/09, 16:29:20] Stuart Mesham: Naas
[2017/07/09, 16:29:44] Stuart Mesham: "unfortunately such names have to be memorised" 😐
[2017/07/09, 16:34:13] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 16:35:11] Stuart Mesham: Jinx!
[2017/07/09, 16:36:21] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 16:40:47] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 16:41:56] Luc Hayward: Really ?
[2017/07/09, 16:42:05] Luc Hayward: I'll setup in a microstrip at your place ?
[2017/07/09, 16:42:10] Luc Hayward: Keep all the installers asseblief
[2017/07/09, 16:42:13] Luc Hayward: I have no wifi
[2017/07/09, 16:42:38] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'll keep the installer
[2017/07/09, 16:42:40] Luc Hayward: Like anything interesting you download keeo for me ?
[2017/07/09, 16:42:53] Stuart Mesham: Kk 👌🏻
[2017/07/09, 16:43:01] Stuart Mesham: I haven't downloaded anything extra
[2017/07/09, 16:43:53] Stuart Mesham: It has git version control stuff built in 🤔
[2017/07/09, 16:44:09] Luc Hayward: Yeah all ides do
[2017/07/09, 16:44:18] Luc Hayward: It's kinda helpful I guess ?
[2017/07/09, 16:44:42] Luc Hayward: But like for big stuff you often want to be using source tree or cmd line tools
[2017/07/09, 16:44:52] Luc Hayward: Especially if your project isn't just code
[2017/07/09, 16:45:08] Luc Hayward: But yeah it has we can look at it sooner time together🤞👌
[2017/07/09, 17:05:07] Stuart Mesham: sout tab works 😄
[2017/07/09, 17:08:01] Stuart Mesham: And it has scene builder built into it in exactly the same way netbeans had a swing designer
[2017/07/09, 17:08:15] Stuart Mesham: Though I kinda prefer using the standalone editor now
[2017/07/09, 17:19:30] Stuart Mesham: Ok back to work
[2017/07/09, 17:50:28] Luc Hayward: Nah I'm done for the night
[2017/07/09, 17:50:54] Luc Hayward: You can still do that. No need to use scenebuilder from inside
[2017/07/09, 17:51:05] Luc Hayward: Also it should be very easy to just detach the panel
[2017/07/09, 18:03:40] Stuart Mesham: Yeah no can still open in the standalone scenebuilder
[2017/07/09, 18:04:21] Stuart Mesham: And it says your settings get synced to all your computers logged into your jetbrains account
[2017/07/09, 18:07:01] Luc Hayward: Yeah it will be.
[2017/07/09, 18:07:10] Luc Hayward: Very impressed by this find
[2017/07/09, 18:07:20] Luc Hayward: When do you get back from holidays??
[2017/07/09, 18:07:29] Luc Hayward: And when are you in Rome
[2017/07/09, 18:08:00] Stuart Mesham: I'm coming back on the 30th
[2017/07/09, 18:08:09] Stuart Mesham: Not sure exactly when I'm in Rome
[2017/07/09, 18:08:13] Luc Hayward: Oh sick so am I!
[2017/07/09, 18:08:20] Stuart Mesham: Awesome
[2017/07/09, 18:08:35] Luc Hayward: Like legit I land on the evening of the 30th
[2017/07/09, 18:08:46] Luc Hayward: Should find out 👍👌
[2017/07/09, 18:08:54] Stuart Mesham: I think I do too, maybe we're on the same flight 😂
[2017/07/09, 18:09:08] Luc Hayward: I fly via dubai
[2017/07/09, 18:09:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/09, 18:09:29] Stuart Mesham: Might be doing that as well, I'll have to ask Dan
[2017/07/09, 18:09:40] Stuart Mesham: We're going via Dubai on the way there
[2017/07/09, 18:15:56] Luc Hayward: Ah ok. That's cool. 😂👌 you must try find out
[2017/07/09, 18:21:05] Stuart Mesham: Ah Dan knows
[2017/07/09, 18:22:15] Stuart Mesham: Dan says we're flying overnight from the 29th to the 30th but we're landing in the morning so probably not the same flight 😆
[2017/07/09, 18:27:35] Luc Hayward: Not the same flight
[2017/07/09, 18:28:26] Stuart Mesham: And we're in Rome from 22nd to 23rd and then a whole lot of little places in Italy after that
[2017/07/09, 18:41:11] Luc Hayward: Will do something when we're back though👌👌
[2017/07/09, 18:41:17] Luc Hayward: Can do some stuff
[2017/07/09, 18:41:40] Luc Hayward: Also can give some tips and tricks and properly set development environments up ?🤞
[2017/07/09, 18:41:49] Luc Hayward: Work out how to collaborate on things etc
[2017/07/09, 18:41:56] Luc Hayward: Awesome
[2017/07/09, 18:42:43] Luc Hayward: Oh no I only arrive in Rome on the 24tg
[2017/07/09, 18:49:23] Stuart Mesham: I give you or you give me? 😄
[2017/07/09, 18:49:39] Stuart Mesham: Nooo
[2017/07/09, 18:50:23] Stuart Mesham: Yes! It would be so cool if we figured this out! 😂
[2017/07/09, 18:52:21] Stuart Mesham: If you come at a good time we can capture Dan and force him to teach us stuff because I see he installed SourceTree on one of our desktops at home so he must know something 😄
[2017/07/09, 18:56:43] Stuart Mesham: Also Dan said that you can get a "pro" GitHub account with your student email as well
[2017/07/09, 20:15:03] Luc Hayward: Both? 🤷‍♂️
[2017/07/09, 20:15:26] Luc Hayward: K deal after we both get back we will chill and work it all out
[2017/07/09, 20:15:44] Luc Hayward: Well we can do whenever👍👍
[2017/07/09, 20:16:03] Luc Hayward: Yeah. Dno what the worthwhileness is for us though
[2017/07/09, 20:17:41] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I dunno
[2017/07/09, 20:18:24] Stuart Mesham: Apparently you get free access to the Unreal Engine too but that's just getting a bit carried away, isn't it 😄
[2017/07/09, 20:18:45] Stuart Mesham: Imagine one day we decided to make something
[2017/07/09, 20:18:57] Stuart Mesham: We would be so ready 😄
[2017/07/09, 20:20:10] Luc Hayward: You get so much out of it (github) and anything you don't get, you can get out of a bit bucket account
[2017/07/09, 20:20:18] Luc Hayward: It's not free
[2017/07/09, 20:20:37] Luc Hayward: Fitnum and ue4 and unity give heavy discounts to students but it's not free
[2017/07/09, 20:20:48] Luc Hayward: Ue4 is free though you don't need to pay
[2017/07/09, 20:21:09] Stuart Mesham: With your student email I meant
[2017/07/09, 20:22:07] Stuart Mesham: Apparently free unreal engine access is part of the "GitHub education pack"
[2017/07/09, 20:27:28] Luc Hayward: UE4 take a share of net profits
[2017/07/09, 20:28:01] Luc Hayward: I think net profit over 20000 USD per annum?? Would need to check
[2017/07/09, 20:28:23] Luc Hayward: Mate unreal engine is free for anybody....
[2017/07/09, 20:28:35] Luc Hayward: I'll show you tomorrow?
[2017/07/09, 20:29:04] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/07/09, 20:29:40] Stuart Mesham: Chilled, I'm not hugely concerned about Unreal Engine because I'll probably never venture past Unity
[2017/07/09, 20:29:57] Luc Hayward: Hmm you should
[2017/07/09, 20:30:01] Luc Hayward: No reason not too
[2017/07/09, 20:30:20] Luc Hayward: Unreal is really good for a lot of stuff
[2017/07/09, 20:30:25] Stuart Mesham: But there's no reason _to_ 😄
[2017/07/09, 20:30:51] Luc Hayward: Shhhh. What's the italics key code
[2017/07/09, 20:30:56] Stuart Mesham: Really really advanced/specific stuff probably?
[2017/07/09, 20:31:02] Stuart Mesham: Underscore
[2017/07/09, 20:32:56] Luc Hayward: Nope. I mean yeah obviously. 
But once you know them view oriented are quick to prototype in. 
And also their included graphics are much more advanced in terms of much of the shaders being there by default, built in material and shader designers and also the particle effects designer is very very good.
[2017/07/09, 20:33:18] Luc Hayward: But yeah unity is totally possible to do everything in just abouy
[2017/07/09, 20:33:47] Luc Hayward: Maybe not massive blockbuster games but anything that big has a big team anyhow
[2017/07/09, 20:34:14] Stuart Mesham: This is key👆🏻
[2017/07/09, 20:34:53] Stuart Mesham: I think I'm unlikely ever to find myself in a hardcore game development team like that
[2017/07/09, 20:35:13] Stuart Mesham: At least not in the foreseeable future
[2017/07/09, 20:35:41] Luc Hayward: The one thing ue4 does do is it's made by a games studio and is open source. So you know that the team developing the engine have direct contact with a team using the engine _to make games_. 

And maybe more interesting to you because you've done more networking than I, their multiplayer solution is leaps and bounds ahead of unity out the box
[2017/07/09, 20:36:42] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah Unity's built in networking is horrendous 😂
[2017/07/09, 20:36:51] Stuart Mesham: I used it to make the tank game
[2017/07/09, 20:37:34] Stuart Mesham: Turns out most people use 3rd party things for Unity networking because the built in stuff is so bad
[2017/07/09, 20:37:53] Stuart Mesham: I of course only realised this after I'd made the tank game
[2017/07/09, 20:40:50] Luc Hayward: They don't even support it anymore I don't think. It's honestly atrocious. There's something called photo? Also not much good.
[2017/07/09, 20:41:08] Luc Hayward: Or you can roll your own from scratch
[2017/07/09, 20:41:20] Stuart Mesham: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/05/10/unity-game-development-with-visual-studio-for-mac/
[2017/07/09, 20:41:31] Stuart Mesham: Yaaaay
[2017/07/09, 20:41:39] Stuart Mesham: Wow it only came out in may this year
[2017/07/09, 20:43:06] Luc Hayward: What??
[2017/07/09, 20:43:08] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/07/09, 20:43:23] Stuart Mesham: Visual Studio for mac
[2017/07/09, 20:43:33] Stuart Mesham: They said it works with Unity
[2017/07/09, 20:43:44] Luc Hayward: Ok so just to be clear, visual studio for mac is really just built on top of xamarin
[2017/07/09, 20:44:02] Luc Hayward: Remember that program I told you about ? Xanarin?
[2017/07/09, 20:44:16] Stuart Mesham: Yeah the cross platform app thing
[2017/07/09, 20:44:37] Luc Hayward: I think Microsoft works with or acquired then a while back and have built a "visual studio like" layer on top.
[2017/07/09, 20:44:58] Luc Hayward: Works very well though, just as good as xamarin of not better
[2017/07/09, 20:45:05] Luc Hayward: It's definitely worth trying out
[2017/07/09, 20:45:13] Stuart Mesham: Did you try it out?
[2017/07/09, 20:45:44] Luc Hayward: Yeah I've been using it since the start of the year (it was in beta when I tried so I'm sure it's better now)
[2017/07/09, 20:46:14] Stuart Mesham: Looks like this is a stable release
[2017/07/09, 20:49:03] Luc Hayward: Download it overnight?
[2017/07/09, 20:49:23] Luc Hayward: When I'm in knysna I'll have wi-fi again so I can go through it
[2017/07/09, 20:50:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah will do that
[2017/07/09, 20:51:18] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 20:58:23] Luc Hayward: Uhm, there is an answer which I'm too tired to remember now.....It's something to do with it being in the state which the element is found in in nature. So oxygen is always O2
[2017/07/09, 20:59:53] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/07/09, 21:01:34] Luc Hayward: But that might be for something else
[2017/07/09, 21:04:29] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/07/09, 21:13:37] Stuart Mesham: Aha
[2017/07/09, 21:26:26] Luc Hayward: Mate
[2017/07/09, 21:26:33] Luc Hayward: They have a python education module
[2017/07/09, 21:26:42] Luc Hayward: Which teaches python in pycharm
[2017/07/09, 21:32:58] Stuart Mesham: UCT?
[2017/07/09, 21:33:11] Luc Hayward: Nah jetbrain
[2017/07/09, 21:33:18] Luc Hayward: Pycharm edu
[2017/07/09, 21:33:24] Luc Hayward: It's full blown pucharm
[2017/07/09, 21:33:23] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/07/09, 21:33:37] Luc Hayward: But it's got like a teaching module too
[2017/07/09, 21:33:42] Luc Hayward: Looks very slick
[2017/07/09, 21:33:50] Luc Hayward: Take a look
[2017/07/09, 21:33:52] Stuart Mesham: Sounds cool
[2017/07/09, 21:33:55] Stuart Mesham: Where?
[2017/07/09, 21:34:04] Luc Hayward: Google pycharm edu
[2017/07/09, 21:34:20] Stuart Mesham: Oh you have to download that
[2017/07/09, 21:34:36] Luc Hayward: Yeah no will it's another plugin I think
[2017/07/09, 21:34:57] Stuart Mesham: We're a bit late to discover this
[2017/07/09, 21:35:13] Stuart Mesham: We've already gone and learnt Python
[2017/07/09, 21:35:20] Luc Hayward: This is true. Might teach some more complex things but eh
[2017/07/09, 21:50:01] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/07/09, 21:50:49] Luc Hayward: Oh I meant to tell you. 
UE4 from like last year now take (well you're required to report it to them but it's not hard to keep track of their games for them) 5% in gross income for every game you release making $3000 per quarter. Being a student doesn't help in that regard anymore. 

Unity is free up to $100k in revenue at which point you shouldn't care that you have to fork out a bit of cash for a pro license.
[2017/07/09, 21:54:07] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah by that point you're rolling in cash anyway 😂
[2017/07/09, 21:54:40] Luc Hayward: So yeah 🤷‍♂️ not great for ue4 and unity. But fantastic for jetbrains and the Gothic stuff looks bawling.
[2017/07/09, 21:54:51] Stuart Mesham: You're making more than R1 million rand a year, I'd happily pay for a pro license and then a Ferrari while I'm at it 😄
[2017/07/09, 21:55:11] Luc Hayward: 1million a year is a lot but not a huge amount hey?
[2017/07/09, 21:55:24] Luc Hayward: That's only 600k after tax
[2017/07/09, 21:55:26] Stuart Mesham: Gothic stuff?
[2017/07/09, 21:55:40] Luc Hayward: Github*
[2017/07/09, 21:55:40] Stuart Mesham: True damn that's not that much
[2017/07/09, 21:55:53] Luc Hayward: It's enough if you're without debt.
[2017/07/09, 21:55:55] Stuart Mesham: Bawling?
[2017/07/09, 21:55:57] Luc Hayward: But housing
[2017/07/09, 21:56:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that's very true
[2017/07/09, 21:57:00] Stuart Mesham: It's 50k a month
[2017/07/09, 21:57:02] Luc Hayward: Ballin* as in cash doller
[2017/07/09, 21:57:33] Luc Hayward: But the premise stands if you make a million rand spend a bit on a license
[2017/07/09, 21:57:46] Stuart Mesham: That's doesn't sound nearly as glamorous as _1 million rand a year_
[2017/07/09, 21:58:12] Stuart Mesham: Yes
[2017/07/09, 21:58:33] Luc Hayward: Let's focus on this😂😂🤞🤞
[2017/07/09, 21:58:53] Luc Hayward: <‎GIF omitted>
[2017/07/09, 21:58:57] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that's what we're aiming for when we game jam
[2017/07/09, 21:59:06] Luc Hayward: Naturally
[2017/07/09, 21:59:05] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/07/09, 21:59:22] Stuart Mesham: We want unity to call us and make us buy a license
[2017/07/09, 21:59:34] Luc Hayward: We really must sort all this stuff out though so we can actually work on stuff and show off projects to each other easily
[2017/07/09, 22:00:06] Stuart Mesham: Yeah life will be a dream when we've got this in action
[2017/07/09, 22:00:37] Luc Hayward: We will sort it all these holidays
[2017/07/09, 22:00:50] Stuart Mesham: I can just see us, 3 years later, at the end our degrees being like "nope we never had time to make anything" 😂
[2017/07/09, 22:01:13] Stuart Mesham: Yeah we'll get a start
[2017/07/09, 22:01:34] Luc Hayward: <‎GIF omitted>
[2017/07/09, 22:01:46] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/07/09, 22:02:40] Stuart Mesham: You got any idea for a first game we could make? (it must be single player or we will die)
[2017/07/09, 22:02:59] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/07/09, 22:03:02] Luc Hayward: I got a few
[2017/07/09, 22:03:15] Stuart Mesham: Really? Are they bad? 😄
[2017/07/09, 22:03:49] Stuart Mesham: Just kidding, don't look so sad
[2017/07/09, 22:03:56] Luc Hayward: <‎GIF omitted>
[2017/07/09, 22:04:01] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/07/09, 22:04:15] Luc Hayward: That fit us too fast I think
[2017/07/09, 22:04:19] Luc Hayward: God is
[2017/07/09, 22:04:20] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/07/09, 22:04:25] Luc Hayward: Gif is fuck
[2017/07/09, 22:04:34] Luc Hayward: Nah ok I'm thinking mobile
[2017/07/09, 22:04:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah mobile would be good
[2017/07/09, 22:05:37] Luc Hayward: I really want to work on a portal implementation but that's anecdotal
[2017/07/09, 22:05:45] Stuart Mesham: It's doesn't really matter if we're spamming the app stores with mediocre games while we're learning, they've got plenty so they can deal with a few more 😄
[2017/07/09, 22:07:14] Luc Hayward: This was just an interesting concept for map reveals. 
Map exploration in a blocky world
https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/6badxb/map_exploration_in_a_blocky_world/?st=J4X5GT6T&sh=906679b2
[2017/07/09, 22:06:44] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah that would be awesome. We'd learn a lot about the cameras etc.
[2017/07/09, 22:08:14] Luc Hayward: This is sick but has networking and would be hard. Interesting as a couch play game on pc. 
First game prototype - Rocket fighting and base defending (tanks/worms like)
https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/6ae04f/first_game_prototype_rocket_fighting_and_base/?st=J4X5HVB6&sh=9b685945
[2017/07/09, 22:08:49] Luc Hayward: These are both just interesting, but not what I'm thinking to start with
[2017/07/09, 22:10:22] Luc Hayward: Something along these lines would be interesting. I saw two people who made a similar "shrinking world" style game. This and one where you circle the center shooting asteroids down. Very nice in that it's a simple concept, polished and distilled. So that's a nice idea(one concept, few mechanics).

[2017/07/09, 22:10:14] Stuart Mesham: Ah that's really cool
[2017/07/09, 22:10:56] Luc Hayward: I already think I know how to do it. Btw you should definitely play portal two.
[2017/07/09, 22:11:23] Luc Hayward: Right click to necromance was really fun to play
[2017/07/09, 22:12:27] Stuart Mesham: Too slow, I played the whole game last year. It was brilliant. 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 10/10
[2017/07/09, 22:13:30] Stuart Mesham: The puzzles sometimes got a bit annoying (mostly when I couldn't figure them out) but the concept + their scripting was amazing 👌🏻
[2017/07/09, 22:14:06] Luc Hayward: But something like this. Really enjoy the aesthetic of it. ?

[2017/07/31, 19:09:25] Luc Hayward: And make something useless with me on Wednesday
[2017/07/31, 19:09:44] Stuart Mesham: Will it be more exciting than making a useless app at home?

[2017/08/17, 23:35:17] Stuart Mesham: Oh shit
[2017/08/17, 23:35:20] Stuart Mesham: Shame
[2017/08/18, 20:40:19] Stuart Mesham: Are you able to lift tomorrow?
[2017/08/18, 21:01:09] Luc Hayward: Can lift you in
[2017/08/18, 21:01:14] Luc Hayward: Not sure about back
[2017/08/18, 21:07:23] Stuart Mesham: Ok not to worry then
[2017/08/18, 21:20:43] Luc Hayward: Sorry
[2017/08/18, 21:20:51] Luc Hayward: I'll message you if something changes though
[2017/08/18, 21:36:13] Stuart Mesham: Not to worry, sounds like I might have to go queue for something at the bank tomorrow morning anyway
[2017/08/18, 21:36:46] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/08/19, 09:46:38] Luc Hayward: See you soon?
[2017/08/19, 09:59:11] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I just parked
[2017/08/19, 10:01:17] Luc Hayward: Running late fuck
[2017/08/19, 10:01:20] Luc Hayward: Keep me space
[2017/08/19, 10:05:04] Luc Hayward: Keep a note of anything interesting for me
[2017/08/19, 10:07:41] Luc Hayward: Is it the same place we met on Wednesday
[2017/08/19, 10:09:00] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/08/19, 10:09:10] Stuart Mesham: Lt303
[2017/08/19, 10:09:22] Stuart Mesham: Third floor and to the left
[2017/08/19, 10:13:13] Stuart Mesham: Chilled we still haven't started
[2017/08/19, 10:16:25] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/08/19, 10:16:51] Stuart Mesham: Yeah projetor's not working 🙈
[2017/08/19, 10:23:57] Luc Hayward: Here
[2017/08/19, 10:34:20] Luc Hayward: Look at the fan covers in the projector
[2017/08/19, 11:49:17] Luc Hayward: Back by 12
[2017/08/20, 15:04:33] Luc Hayward: you got a spare mouse you dont want anymore?
[2017/08/20, 15:06:59] Stuart Mesham: I'm afraid I still use the pink mouse in res, sorry 🙈
[2017/08/20, 15:07:15] Stuart Mesham: What do you want one for?
[2017/08/20, 15:07:53] Stuart Mesham: Also did Chris tell you he's leaving next weekend?
[2017/08/20, 15:08:07] Luc Hayward: chilled
[2017/08/20, 15:08:09] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/08/20, 15:08:13] Luc Hayward: chris doesnt speak to people
[2017/08/20, 15:08:19] Luc Hayward: next weekend as in this weekend (not today)
[2017/08/20, 15:08:27] Stuart Mesham: Oh well I just found that out 😂
[2017/08/20, 15:08:33] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/08/20, 15:08:42] Stuart Mesham: 7 days time
[2017/08/20, 15:08:47] Luc Hayward: wow
[2017/08/20, 15:08:55] Luc Hayward: so he was just going to leave
[2017/08/20, 15:09:06] Stuart Mesham: Yeah maybe 😂
[2017/08/20, 15:09:15] Stuart Mesham: It's Chris, you never know 😄
[2017/08/20, 15:12:59] Luc Hayward: what a chop
[2017/08/21, 08:56:49] Luc Hayward: You coming?
[2017/08/21, 11:16:07] Luc Hayward: Can keegan borrow your hard copy of the maths textbook for a few days?
[2017/08/21, 11:17:39] Stuart Mesham: Yeah sure
[2017/08/21, 11:19:37] Luc Hayward: do you have it at res or at home?
[2017/08/21, 11:20:15] Stuart Mesham: It's at res
[2017/08/21, 11:44:28] Luc Hayward: Bring tomorrow
[2017/08/22, 13:40:17] Stuart Mesham: https://vimeo.com/37267733#t=550s
[2017/08/23, 19:19:49] Luc Hayward: How long is this practical going to take me tomorrow?
[2017/08/23, 19:21:45] Stuart Mesham: 1 hour if you do it blazingly fast
[2017/08/23, 19:23:07] Stuart Mesham: Did you finish your Chem tut?
[2017/08/23, 19:27:33] Stuart Mesham: If so, pls tell me what to do for the last question 🙏🏻
[2017/08/23, 19:35:46] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/08/23, 19:36:21] Luc Hayward: Search crystalline .... Whatever it is the 5 crystal something from the question. Search textbook
[2017/08/23, 19:37:42] Luc Hayward: Give you the lost with the 5 different structures and boiling points and all
[2017/08/23, 19:42:20] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks
[2017/08/24, 15:43:22] Stuart Mesham: Ok Dan says he's leaving at 5 tomorrow so I'll have all the time in the world
[2017/08/24, 15:43:32] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/08/24, 15:44:00] Luc Hayward: I'll check what time he's coming in
[2017/08/24, 15:55:57] Stuart Mesham: http://www.mathemafrica.org/?p=10846

Why does this work (at the end of his integral of tanθ?
-ln|cosθ| + C = ln|secθ| + C
[2017/08/24, 15:59:15] Luc Hayward: so ln(cos) must be equal to -ln(sec) i guess...
[2017/08/24, 15:59:20] Luc Hayward: I never knew that
[2017/08/24, 15:59:48] Stuart Mesham: Maybe it's just a rule/identity
[2017/08/24, 16:00:24] Luc Hayward: maybe
[2017/08/24, 16:01:11] Luc Hayward: well ln(cos) = e^what?
[2017/08/24, 16:03:40] Stuart Mesham: Oooh I think I get it
[2017/08/24, 16:04:22] Stuart Mesham: if sec = 1/cos
[2017/08/24, 16:04:50] Stuart Mesham: 3^2 = 9 and 3^-2 = 1/9
[2017/08/24, 16:05:11] Luc Hayward: yep
[2017/08/24, 16:05:33] Luc Hayward: no wait i dont understand
[2017/08/24, 16:05:36] Luc Hayward: what does ln mean
[2017/08/24, 16:05:38] Stuart Mesham: So if e^z = cos then e^-z = 1/cos = sec
[2017/08/24, 16:06:49] Luc Hayward: so if e^z = cos, does ln(cos) = z?
[2017/08/24, 16:06:56] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/08/24, 16:07:01] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/08/24, 17:15:33] Luc Hayward: Bring that book tomorrow?
[2017/08/24, 17:33:27] Stuart Mesham: The maths textbook?
[2017/08/24, 18:15:39] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/08/25, 16:10:57] Luc Hayward: wow this is awful
[2017/08/25, 16:11:01] Luc Hayward: have you dont the testing ?
[2017/08/25, 16:11:30] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/08/25, 16:11:39] Luc Hayward: testcollator?
[2017/08/25, 16:11:42] Luc Hayward: I dont understand what to do
[2017/08/25, 16:11:51] Luc Hayward: how do i know what tests to do in what order
[2017/08/25, 16:12:05] Luc Hayward: like I get that I'm testing that it does what it says...
[2017/08/25, 16:13:17] Stuart Mesham: You don't have to stick to any particular number / order
[2017/08/25, 16:13:39] Luc Hayward: I'm very much not understanding it then
[2017/08/25, 16:14:04] Stuart Mesham: You just have to output
"Test 5"
"Pass"
"Test 6"
"Fail"
etc.
[2017/08/25, 16:14:12] Luc Hayward: i know
[2017/08/25, 16:14:22] Luc Hayward: how do we know what test 5 is testing vs what test 6 is testing
[2017/08/25, 16:15:29] Stuart Mesham: It doesn't matter, the automarker just checks that you've output at least one "Fail" if the collator class doesn't work as expected
[2017/08/25, 16:15:40] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/08/25, 16:15:41] Luc Hayward: ok?
[2017/08/25, 16:15:46] Luc Hayward: that's weird...
[2017/08/25, 16:16:05] Stuart Mesham: Yeah you can do as many tests as you want
[2017/08/25, 16:16:12] Luc Hayward: so i assume I need to have what? 14 tests?
[2017/08/25, 16:17:12] Stuart Mesham: I just did lots and lots of tests. Each time I called a method on the collator, I copied and pasted all my tests 🙈
[2017/08/25, 16:17:29] Luc Hayward: ... huh?
[2017/08/25, 16:17:56] Luc Hayward: there are 7 methods and a constructor for the collator class
[2017/08/25, 16:18:04] Luc Hayward: did you just do one test for each?
[2017/08/25, 16:18:17] Stuart Mesham: Like I checked that all the variables where right, called a record method and then checked that all the variables were right again etc.
[2017/08/25, 16:18:31] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/08/25, 16:18:36] Luc Hayward: oh ok
[2017/08/25, 16:18:54] Luc Hayward: I'll try that and if it doesnt work can i send you mine and you can yell at me where i screwed up
[2017/08/25, 16:29:40] Luc Hayward: also help faith she's struggling and bugging me 😂😂
[2017/08/25, 16:39:27] Luc Hayward: I hate my life please help
[2017/08/25, 16:54:42] Stuart Mesham: Ok what's happening?😂
[2017/08/25, 16:54:54] Luc Hayward: Nah I think its ok
[2017/08/25, 16:55:06] Luc Hayward: will run it throught the automarker after i finish the meteorology one
[2017/08/25, 16:55:12] Luc Hayward: and faith is sorted
[2017/08/25, 16:55:18] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/08/25, 17:12:57] Luc Hayward: laugh this all works first try
[2017/08/25, 17:15:02] Luc Hayward: 83 first try
[2017/08/25, 17:15:08] Luc Hayward: its the last two that were tripping it up
[2017/08/25, 17:17:14] Luc Hayward: not really understanding what to do to fix it actually
[2017/08/25, 17:18:06] Luc Hayward: I got to trial 9 and then it isnt detecting a fault in: recordReading(), Average(), label(String)
[2017/08/25, 17:18:18] Luc Hayward: but it manages all the other trials i presume
[2017/08/25, 17:18:28] Luc Hayward: just missing three times
[2017/08/25, 17:19:15] Stuart Mesham: You gotta test stuff like changing the Max and changing the min etc
[2017/08/25, 17:19:43] Luc Hayward: but it detects those
[2017/08/25, 17:20:01] Stuart Mesham: Wut
[2017/08/25, 17:20:22] Luc Hayward: sent it to you
[2017/08/25, 17:20:31] Luc Hayward: I just kept rerunning tests haha
[2017/08/25, 17:21:36] Stuart Mesham: Ok just having tea will check soon
[2017/08/25, 17:21:45] Luc Hayward: thanks
[2017/08/25, 17:30:47] Luc Hayward: ok got rid of the recordReading average
[2017/08/25, 17:31:44] Stuart Mesham: Maybe also check that setLabel doesn't randomly change the max and min etc.
[2017/08/25, 17:32:27] Stuart Mesham: I literally tested _everything_ after each time I called a method on the collator
[2017/08/25, 17:33:06] Luc Hayward: yeah check what i sent you(refresh it) it literally checks everything I dont know what else to check
[2017/08/25, 17:39:49] Stuart Mesham: What does the automarker say now?
[2017/08/25, 17:40:04] Luc Hayward: label and average sometimes have issues
[2017/08/25, 17:40:13] Luc Hayward: actually onmly once each
[2017/08/25, 17:41:36] Stuart Mesham: I don't know what's wrong, it's sooo long 😂
[2017/08/25, 17:42:09] Stuart Mesham: I'll give you my tests, just don't copy them exactly 🙈
[2017/08/25, 17:43:13] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/08/25, 17:46:05] Luc Hayward: whats all this assert shit
[2017/08/25, 17:46:22] Stuart Mesham: I made a method
[2017/08/25, 17:46:35] Stuart Mesham: Don't you dare make a method now 😂
[2017/08/25, 17:46:45] Luc Hayward: if true print true else print false?
[2017/08/25, 17:46:54] Luc Hayward: pass fail *
[2017/08/25, 17:47:03] Stuart Mesham: Yeah and it does the number for me
[2017/08/25, 17:47:17] Luc Hayward: smart ok ill try that
[2017/08/25, 17:47:33] Stuart Mesham: No don't
[2017/08/25, 17:47:47] Luc Hayward: no no i meant your methods
[2017/08/25, 17:47:51] Stuart Mesham: Just copy paste your ones
[2017/08/25, 17:47:52] Luc Hayward: your tests
[2017/08/25, 17:47:55] Stuart Mesham: Ok yeah
[2017/08/25, 17:48:02] Luc Hayward: i must just have missed one
[2017/08/25, 17:48:30] Stuart Mesham: But do slightly different numbers of course
[2017/08/25, 18:07:08] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/08/25, 18:23:53] Luc Hayward: ;xzklsdfbb.ljkgfdsbjbjl;
[2017/08/25, 18:25:55] Luc Hayward: I'm going to shred Aslams cat
[2017/08/25, 18:57:45] Luc Hayward: FUCK YES BOISBOISBOISBOISBOISBOISBOISBOISBOISBOIS
[2017/08/25, 18:57:48] Luc Hayward: 100
[2017/08/25, 18:57:53] Luc Hayward: fucking finally
[2017/08/25, 18:58:04] Luc Hayward: only took 5 tries but felt like more
[2017/08/25, 18:58:36] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/08/25, 18:58:46] Luc Hayward: would have been so much easier if i had fully read everything and realised that i needed to do special formatting (always two dp, - instead of 0) for the last one
[2017/08/25, 18:59:35] Stuart Mesham: I also only saw that in the automarker! Did it even say that in the question??
[2017/08/25, 18:59:48] Luc Hayward: no but it is one of the sample outputs
[2017/08/25, 19:00:02] Luc Hayward: also i had worked out my averages wrong
[2017/08/25, 19:00:09] Luc Hayward: that's what was tripping me up
[2017/08/25, 19:00:21] Luc Hayward: the very last double check to test methods had an average that was out by one
[2017/08/25, 19:01:11] Stuart Mesham: Oh awkward
[2017/08/25, 19:01:57] Luc Hayward: yeah awks
[2017/08/25, 19:02:15] Luc Hayward: also as im sure you realised, never did the graph question
[2017/08/25, 22:00:17] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/08/25, 22:00:44] Stuart Mesham: I found my snakes and ladders thing though!
[2017/08/26, 08:58:53] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/08/26, 09:00:16] Luc Hayward: Nice
[2017/08/26, 09:57:56] Luc Hayward: Hoe where you at
[2017/08/26, 20:21:46] Luc Hayward: Ndjdixy
[2017/08/26, 20:21:53] Luc Hayward: Left my bag in your car ffs
[2017/08/26, 20:22:00] Luc Hayward: I'll have to swing over tomorrow for it
[2017/08/26, 20:22:09] Luc Hayward: What time would work for you
[2017/08/26, 20:48:17] Stuart Mesham: I'll be here the whole day so anytime is good 👍🏻
[2017/08/26, 20:48:32] Luc Hayward: You forget how early I wake up😂
[2017/08/26, 20:49:41] Stuart Mesham: Ok anytime after 9 again 😂
[2017/08/26, 20:50:57] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/08/26, 21:00:41] Stuart Mesham: Update: actually come before 10, I found out we're having people over for my Dad's birthday tomorrow
[2017/08/26, 21:01:21] Luc Hayward: I'm up from 7
[2017/08/26, 21:43:04] Stuart Mesham: So my shopping mall thing gets the right output if I set the lift distance to 0
[2017/08/26, 21:43:56] Stuart Mesham: I think they either made a mistake or worded the question poorly because if using the lift takes 1 meter then the sample outputs don't seem to be the shortest paths
[2017/08/26, 21:44:20] Stuart Mesham: But if you make it so that using the lift takes 0 meters then the sample outputs are the shortest paths
[2017/08/26, 21:44:36] Luc Hayward: Hmm?
[2017/08/26, 21:44:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/08/26, 21:45:15] Stuart Mesham: I'll show you on Monday
[2017/08/26, 21:45:29] Stuart Mesham: Or maybe tomorrow actually 😂
[2017/08/26, 21:46:13] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/08/26, 21:46:16] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/08/26, 21:46:23] Luc Hayward: Lifts are single cost
[2017/08/26, 21:46:30] Stuart Mesham: ?
[2017/08/26, 21:46:38] Luc Hayward: You must have another error
[2017/08/26, 21:46:53] Luc Hayward: There is no zero cost method that I can think of
[2017/08/26, 21:47:05] Luc Hayward: Can a lift to in two directions
[2017/08/26, 21:47:17] Stuart Mesham: No for the second sample taking the stairs straight from the start to the end is faster than their route of walking to the lift and then using the lift
[2017/08/26, 21:47:59] Stuart Mesham: So my output for the second test case is "1 2" if the lift is 1
[2017/08/26, 21:48:27] Stuart Mesham: And if you work it out manually it is actually shorter than "1 0 2" if the lift costs 1
[2017/08/26, 21:52:40] Stuart Mesham: You on your desktop?
[2017/08/26, 21:52:53] Luc Hayward: I'm not looking at the problem now show me tomorrow?
[2017/08/26, 21:53:09] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/08/26, 21:58:46] Luc Hayward: Did you draw the graph?
[2017/08/26, 21:59:03] Stuart Mesham: No 😂
[2017/08/26, 21:59:17] Luc Hayward: Work it out manually
[2017/08/26, 22:00:03] Stuart Mesham: It's walking from 1 to 0 and then using the lift from 0 to 2 vs. taking the stairs straight from 1 to 2
[2017/08/26, 22:01:08] Luc Hayward: I don't know the distances
[2017/08/26, 22:01:12] Luc Hayward: Just sketch the graph
[2017/08/26, 22:01:24] Stuart Mesham: No you don't need to 😂
[2017/08/26, 22:01:36] Stuart Mesham: I'll show you my values
[2017/08/26, 22:04:20] Stuart Mesham: Point 0: 3 2 3
Point 1: 3 5 3
Point 2: 2 2 3
[2017/08/26, 22:05:59] Stuart Mesham: 1 to 0: 3.0 (walking)
0 to 2: 1.0 (lift)
Total: 4.0
[2017/08/26, 22:07:32] Stuart Mesham: 1 to 2: 3.16 (lift)
Total: 3.16
[2017/08/26, 22:11:49] Luc Hayward: You can't take a lift from 1 to 2
[2017/08/26, 22:11:55] Luc Hayward: Thats impossible
[2017/08/26, 22:12:04] Luc Hayward: Lifts only go up or down floors
[2017/08/26, 22:32:58] Stuart Mesham: *stairs
[2017/08/26, 22:33:12] Stuart Mesham: *(stairs)
[2017/08/27, 12:47:22] Luc Hayward: when you get  a chance later please can you try to submit problem0 of the challenge series ??
[2017/08/27, 12:47:39] Luc Hayward: its the same as last semester just priint whatever is input
[2017/08/27, 12:47:53] Luc Hayward: but for the life of me i cant get it to be correct
[2017/08/27, 12:48:22] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/08/27, 13:35:05] Luc Hayward: literally even tried a buffered reader
[2017/08/27, 14:07:40] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/08/27, 14:07:58] Stuart Mesham: Oh I found the problem in the shopping one
[2017/08/27, 14:08:00] Luc Hayward: Literally no clue what I’ve done wrong but I’m sure its really dumb
[2017/08/27, 14:08:32] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I remember struggling with this last semester 😂
[2017/08/27, 14:09:29] Luc Hayward: I checked, last semester you and I each managed in 5 attempts. I wish she would put out a sample program for problem0 that we could just see what she was after. Because I copied her sample that is in the problem description exactly and even that doesn’t get accepted
[2017/08/27, 14:09:39] Stuart Mesham: But for the one the parameters in my Node class constructor were in the wrong order so the x position was going into the floors variable etc. 🙈
[2017/08/27, 14:10:00] Stuart Mesham: I'll try now
[2017/08/27, 14:12:29] Luc Hayward: ahhhhh that makes sense
[2017/08/27, 14:12:43] Luc Hayward: 💜
[2017/08/27, 14:21:12] Stuart Mesham: Got hundies bru 💯😄
[2017/08/27, 14:21:22] Luc Hayward: What the fuck how
[2017/08/27, 14:22:03] Stuart Mesham: while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
sout(scanner.nextLine());
}
[2017/08/27, 14:22:17] Luc Hayward: Literally tried that
[2017/08/27, 14:22:34] Stuart Mesham: Well it got me hundies 😂
[2017/08/27, 14:25:37] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/08/27, 14:25:49] Luc Hayward: Worked now
[2017/08/27, 14:25:56] Luc Hayward: Literally had that earlier though
[2017/08/27, 14:26:48] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/08/27, 14:27:44] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/08/27, 14:28:55] Luc Hayward: I dunbo
[2017/08/27, 14:29:02] Luc Hayward: Oh well
[2017/08/27, 14:29:04] Luc Hayward: Weird
[2017/08/27, 15:04:07] Stuart Mesham: I think this didn't work because they want it to actually end the program when they reach the end of their input
[2017/08/27, 15:04:51] Stuart Mesham: scanner.hasNext() is always true when you input from the console but they must be inputting in some way where the input "ends"
[2017/08/27, 15:05:06] Luc Hayward: Yeah that's what I thought ??
[2017/08/27, 15:05:31] Stuart Mesham: Yeah can't say I entirely know what's going on there though 😂
[2017/08/27, 15:05:48] Luc Hayward: If you run yours from the console does it run indefinitely
[2017/08/27, 15:05:54] Stuart Mesham: I think I finally know how to use git
[2017/08/27, 15:05:59] Luc Hayward: Oh?
[2017/08/27, 15:06:01] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/08/27, 15:06:12] Luc Hayward: Why only now
[2017/08/27, 15:06:18] Stuart Mesham: Yeah hold on let me send you think fantastic link
[2017/08/27, 15:06:41] Luc Hayward: Did you not understand previously 😂
[2017/08/27, 15:06:43] Stuart Mesham: I knew the broad "theory" of what it does but the technical details of using it I mean
[2017/08/27, 15:07:13] Luc Hayward: Oh? Ok what have you now learned
[2017/08/27, 15:07:47] Stuart Mesham: Like what the checkout, reset, add, remove, commit vs push etc. do
[2017/08/27, 15:08:24] Stuart Mesham: https://try.github.io/
[2017/08/27, 15:08:51] Stuart Mesham: Anyway, with my newfound git skills I made a repo
[2017/08/27, 15:09:04] Stuart Mesham: https://github.com/stumes3/challenge_practise
[2017/08/27, 15:09:14] Stuart Mesham: Please make one too 😂
[2017/08/27, 15:44:06] Luc Hayward: Totally missed the messages
[2017/08/27, 15:44:21] Luc Hayward: Hangouts ?
[2017/08/27, 15:54:39] Luc Hayward: If you're free
[2017/08/27, 15:55:17] Stuart Mesham: Wut
[2017/08/27, 15:55:24] Stuart Mesham: If you want
[2017/08/27, 15:55:31] Stuart Mesham: What for though?
[2017/08/27, 15:55:38] Stuart Mesham: I'm free
[2017/08/27, 15:56:05] Luc Hayward: To explain what you wanted to share with me I'm too lazy to read all that straight away
[2017/08/27, 15:56:22] Stuart Mesham: The git stuff?
[2017/08/27, 15:56:33] Luc Hayward: Y
[2017/08/27, 15:56:34] Luc Hayward: Ye
[2017/08/27, 15:56:44] Luc Hayward: Easier than typing
[2017/08/27, 15:57:03] Stuart Mesham: Oh it's basically just this thing
[2017/08/27, 15:57:38] Luc Hayward: But I already know git so like it's easier to just chat and hear what you learned
[2017/08/27, 15:57:18] Stuart Mesham: Just click on it quick
[2017/08/27, 15:57:32] Stuart Mesham: It's this interactive thing
[2017/08/27, 15:57:43] Stuart Mesham: On your laptop though
[2017/08/27, 15:58:18] Stuart Mesham: It'll make you know git _better_ 😄
[2017/08/27, 15:58:27] Luc Hayward: on my pc
[2017/08/27, 15:58:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah just look at it quickly 😂
[2017/08/27, 15:58:55] Luc Hayward: oh i used this site
[2017/08/27, 15:59:16] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok yeah then that's all
[2017/08/27, 15:59:34] Stuart Mesham: I don't have much else to say
[2017/08/27, 15:59:53] Luc Hayward: ah ok
[2017/08/27, 16:00:05] Luc Hayward: so do you better understand now how to use git ?
[2017/08/27, 16:00:34] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/08/27, 16:00:46] Luc Hayward: good xD
[2017/08/27, 16:00:53] Luc Hayward: and how have you been using it?
[2017/08/27, 16:01:05] Luc Hayward: command line/in ide/ using something like gitkraken
[2017/08/27, 16:01:15] Stuart Mesham: So now we can code together _one day_ 🌈
[2017/08/27, 16:01:36] Stuart Mesham: I've been using command line + ide
[2017/08/27, 16:02:33] Luc Hayward: why command line? I dont mind either way xD just curious
[2017/08/27, 16:02:05] Stuart Mesham: I think I mostly know how to use it now 😄
[2017/08/27, 16:02:52] Stuart Mesham: I haven't tried branching/merging on my own yet though, just that tutorial
[2017/08/27, 16:03:16] Stuart Mesham: Some of the commands I can't find buttons for in the ide
[2017/08/27, 16:03:17] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/08/27, 16:03:24] Luc Hayward: which ones?
[2017/08/27, 16:03:56] Stuart Mesham: Like removing a file from the git repo but not from your pc
[2017/08/27, 16:04:15] Stuart Mesham: You can use the command line from within the ide though
[2017/08/27, 16:04:47] Luc Hayward: in intelliJ you need to swap to the remote repo you want to edit, edit that and then switch back to the local repo and not pull the changes
[2017/08/27, 16:05:31] Stuart Mesham: Nah just use the command line and be done in like 5 seconds 😏
[2017/08/27, 16:05:52] Luc Hayward: what would the use case be for that though
[2017/08/27, 16:05:55] Stuart Mesham: git rm --cache "file.txt"
[2017/08/27, 16:07:17] Stuart Mesham: Well I was trying to version control-ify an Android project and there are a whole bunch of files that you don't want to upload but I accidentally added them
[2017/08/27, 16:07:39] Luc Hayward: before adding you .ignore?
[2017/08/27, 16:08:15] Luc Hayward: I'd probably just unstage and recommit or do it from gitkraken or browser
[2017/08/27, 16:08:18] Stuart Mesham: No individual files that I created in the project
[2017/08/27, 16:08:37] Stuart Mesham: But it's easier to do it with the command inside the ide
[2017/08/27, 16:08:49] Luc Hayward: yeah so just put them in a .ignore or dont stage them in the commit
[2017/08/27, 16:09:07] Luc Hayward: ymm
[2017/08/27, 16:09:11] Luc Hayward: ymmv
[2017/08/27, 16:09:12] Stuart Mesham: I accidentally added them ok? 😂
[2017/08/27, 16:09:48] Stuart Mesham: We can agree to disagree for now 😄
[2017/08/27, 16:10:07] Stuart Mesham: Until a later stage when we care more about this
[2017/08/27, 16:10:29] Stuart Mesham: And know more about this
[2017/08/27, 16:12:29] Luc Hayward: no like all 4 of those are totally valid, one just works better for some than others hence i said ymmv (your mileage may vary)
[2017/08/27, 16:20:51] Stuart Mesham: I thought ymmv was a grunting noise 😄
[2017/08/27, 16:21:15] Luc Hayward: oh no man haha
[2017/08/27, 16:21:19] Luc Hayward: I'm not that rude
[2017/08/27, 16:42:49] Luc Hayward: challenge_practise you spelled practice wrong
[2017/08/27, 16:48:22] Stuart Mesham: Oh my goodness! 😂 I spelt first spelt it like that and then I went back into the settings and renamed it! 🙈
[2017/08/27, 16:48:28] Luc Hayward: gg
[2017/08/27, 16:48:28] Stuart Mesham: I'll change it back now
[2017/08/27, 16:49:10] Stuart Mesham: Ok it's spelt right now
[2017/08/27, 16:50:04] Luc Hayward: cool beans
[2017/08/29, 08:08:17] Luc Hayward: I sent keet that email
[2017/08/29, 10:20:54] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>

[2017/08/29, 18:44:59] Luc Hayward: 😂😂😂
[2017/08/29, 18:45:13] Stuart Mesham: That was pretty quick hey? 😂
[2017/08/29, 18:45:14] Luc Hayward: also only for android
[2017/08/29, 18:45:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😄
[2017/08/29, 18:46:00] Luc Hayward: very fast
[2017/08/29, 18:46:02] Luc Hayward: couple of months
[2017/08/29, 18:46:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah they were like "oh shit, this looks good" 😄
[2017/08/29, 18:47:01] Stuart Mesham: Rip off straight away
[2017/08/29, 18:48:46] Luc Hayward: I think they were like "Oh shit nobody is going to use tango
[2017/08/29, 18:49:07] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😂
[2017/08/29, 18:49:18] Luc Hayward: anyway working on stats chat around half past
[2017/08/29, 18:49:28] Stuart Mesham: Ok cheers
[2017/08/29, 20:04:06] Luc Hayward: Ah
[2017/08/29, 20:04:12] Luc Hayward: Ay
[2017/08/29, 20:04:29] Stuart Mesham: Ay
[2017/08/29, 20:04:52] Stuart Mesham: So comp sci prac test tomorrow?
[2017/08/29, 20:05:13] Luc Hayward: <‎GIF omitted>
[2017/08/29, 20:05:26] Luc Hayward: Apparently it's piss easy
[2017/08/29, 20:05:42] Stuart Mesham: Awesome
[2017/08/29, 20:05:52] Stuart Mesham: I believe whoever said that 😄
[2017/08/29, 20:06:16] Luc Hayward: Yeah like simple loops
[2017/08/29, 20:08:48] Stuart Mesham: ^
[2017/08/29, 20:09:17] Luc Hayward: It was Keegan🤷‍♂️😂
[2017/08/29, 20:10:21] Stuart Mesham: Oh it was Keegan so you never know, it might be a really hard test 😄
[2017/08/29, 20:10:44] Stuart Mesham: The compsci pro
[2017/08/29, 20:11:08] Luc Hayward: No he isn't fantastic at the practical stuff
[2017/08/29, 20:12:24] Stuart Mesham: Phew, then we can relax again 😅
[2017/08/29, 20:12:47] Stuart Mesham: So uh, have you done any maths tutorial?
[2017/08/29, 20:13:08] Luc Hayward: I rate i can finish before quarter part
[2017/08/29, 20:14:41] Stuart Mesham: ...with jGrasp, but with IntelliJ... 🤔
[2017/08/29, 20:15:36] Luc Hayward: Are you saying it's faster or slower with intellij
[2017/08/29, 20:16:16] Stuart Mesham: I would not be saying that anything could be slower than jGrasp
[2017/08/29, 20:17:07] Luc Hayward: 😂j grasp is perfectly fat for simple stuff
[2017/08/29, 20:17:11] Luc Hayward: Fast
[2017/08/29, 20:17:52] Stuart Mesham: But I make spelling mistakes!
[2017/08/29, 20:18:15] Stuart Mesham: And it doesn't close brackets!
[2017/08/29, 20:18:27] Luc Hayward: This is true.
[2017/08/29, 20:18:46] Stuart Mesham: JGrasp is a lot worse than sublime
[2017/08/29, 20:19:21] Luc Hayward: Yes I keep saying that
[2017/08/29, 20:20:37] Stuart Mesham: I mean from an actual typing code point of view 😂
[2017/08/29, 20:22:45] Luc Hayward: Generally.
[2017/08/29, 20:23:07] Stuart Mesham: Except for the run button 😂
[2017/08/29, 20:23:30] Luc Hayward: Eh just copy across our compile from command line
[2017/08/29, 20:24:12] Luc Hayward: <‎GIF omitted>
[2017/08/29, 20:24:20] Stuart Mesham: Not copy. That's gross.
[2017/08/29, 20:24:27] Stuart Mesham: Maybe command line
[2017/08/29, 20:24:30] Luc Hayward: Don't even have to copy
[2017/08/29, 20:24:41] Luc Hayward: Have the file open in both it will auto update
[2017/08/29, 20:24:53] Stuart Mesham: If you can do compile and run in one like and then go up, enter each time
[2017/08/29, 20:25:12] Luc Hayward: Nope have to compile then run
[2017/08/29, 20:25:12] Stuart Mesham: I doubt jGrasp auto updates
[2017/08/29, 20:25:36] Stuart Mesham: I mean have both commands one after each other in one line
[2017/08/29, 20:26:23] Stuart Mesham: Anyway, moving on from this heated discussion, they learnt how to use return on Friday
[2017/08/29, 20:27:51] Luc Hayward: If you have both of them open to the same file, when you make changes in one they will show up when you swap to the other
[2017/08/29, 20:28:15] Stuart Mesham: Did you test that?
[2017/08/29, 20:28:28] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/08/29, 20:28:42] Luc Hayward: It's how I often do the assignments if they need jgrasp
[2017/08/29, 20:29:01] Stuart Mesham: Oh I'm surprised jGrasp has that but it doesn't have bracket closing
[2017/08/29, 20:29:18] Stuart Mesham: That seems too advanced for jGrasp 🙈
[2017/08/29, 20:30:10] Luc Hayward: But it's not a fancy thing
[2017/08/29, 20:30:30] Luc Hayward: If you change something in an open file, it changes the file
[2017/08/29, 20:30:38] Luc Hayward: Jgrasp is just editing a file
[2017/08/29, 20:31:59] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/08/29, 20:33:20] Luc Hayward: Hit always reload
[2017/08/29, 20:33:27] Luc Hayward: Then it does it automatically
[2017/08/29, 20:34:12] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/08/29, 20:35:13] Luc Hayward: Pretty helpful
[2017/08/30, 08:26:23] Luc Hayward: Going to be fucking soaked
[2017/08/30, 08:39:58] Stuart Mesham: Damn weather forecast
[2017/08/30, 08:40:29] Stuart Mesham: Motherf***er lied to us 😂
[2017/08/30, 08:42:52] Luc Hayward: I'm going to be fucking soaked
[2017/08/30, 08:42:58] Luc Hayward: Fuuuuuck this
[2017/08/30, 08:43:05] Luc Hayward: Uber is nearly 3x

[2017/08/30, 12:56:21] Luc Hayward: Ah ok was gonna go before the tut
[2017/08/30, 12:57:05] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm already in the line so I'm just gonna get mine now and then go back to NLT
[2017/08/30, 12:57:39] Luc Hayward: See you then
[2017/08/30, 13:02:06] Stuart Mesham: 😂 brilliant 👌🏻
[2017/08/30, 19:33:52] Stuart Mesham: Was your answer for 6 iv 100.0220 °C?
[2017/08/30, 19:34:55] Luc Hayward: What's the question
[2017/08/30, 19:35:22] Stuart Mesham: Calculate the boiling point of the antifreeze solution
[2017/08/30, 19:35:48] Stuart Mesham: It's quite long/depends on the answers to the previous questions
[2017/08/30, 19:35:57] Luc Hayward: Couldn't have been bothered
[2017/08/30, 19:36:30] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/08/30, 19:36:44] Luc Hayward: I know it
[2017/08/30, 19:36:57] Stuart Mesham: Did you just skip?
[2017/08/30, 19:37:03] Luc Hayward: I stopped after 3
[2017/08/30, 19:37:15] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/08/30, 21:46:14] Stuart Mesham: They're smoking weed again fffffuuuuuuuu
[2017/08/30, 21:46:37] Stuart Mesham: I hope they OD and die before I do
[2017/08/30, 21:47:25] Luc Hayward: Thats like 450 pounds of weed out something
[2017/08/30, 21:47:45] Stuart Mesham: I wouldn't put it past them
[2017/08/31, 08:38:46] Luc Hayward: Tell me when you're almost here
[2017/08/31, 08:53:33] Stuart Mesham: Almost here
[2017/08/31, 08:53:36] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm here
[2017/08/31, 08:53:55] Luc Hayward: Forgot we have Tut's
[2017/08/31, 08:54:18] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah
[2017/08/31, 08:54:22] Stuart Mesham: Forgot that too
[2017/08/31, 14:24:47] Stuart Mesham: If you want a lift in at 9 tomorrow, I'm staying at home tonight and going in with Dan at 9
[2017/08/31, 15:34:32] Luc Hayward: At 9 ? Our lecture starts at 9
[2017/08/31, 15:34:55] Stuart Mesham: To get there at 9 I mean
[2017/08/31, 15:36:04] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/08/31, 15:36:22] Luc Hayward: Will let you know
[2017/08/31, 19:15:55] Luc Hayward: what do i conclude from my chemistry prac xD
[2017/08/31, 21:17:56] Stuart Mesham: My conclusion was one sentence 😄
[2017/08/31, 21:18:24] Luc Hayward: Same
[2017/08/31, 21:18:24] Stuart Mesham: Basically "The unknown salt contained I- anions."
[2017/08/31, 21:56:08] Luc Hayward: 🙏🏻
[2017/08/31, 22:03:06] Stuart Mesham: Ok no problem, he says he's leaving at around 8:05
[2017/08/31, 22:03:18] Luc Hayward: Yeah I know the drill😂👍👍
[2017/08/31, 22:03:28] Stuart Mesham: Oh right yeah 😂
[2017/09/01, 06:54:38] Luc Hayward: Actually taking the car in today because I end so early
[2017/09/01, 07:16:27] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/09/01, 08:24:03] Luc Hayward: Shall I wait for you 😂
[2017/09/01, 08:24:15] Luc Hayward: You just drive passed me I assume to park along the road
[2017/09/01, 08:31:17] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah 😂
[2017/09/01, 08:31:37] Stuart Mesham: Soz didn't check my phone, I'm downstairs in the NLT now
[2017/09/01, 08:32:06] Luc Hayward: 😂ah ok
[2017/09/01, 08:32:10] Luc Hayward: I went to chemistry
[2017/09/01, 08:32:28] Stuart Mesham: Are you just gonna wait in the lecture theatre?
[2017/09/01, 08:32:40] Luc Hayward: Basically
[2017/09/01, 08:33:33] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'll be there in a bit
[2017/09/01, 08:33:53] Luc Hayward: It's full this morning bugger. Waiting in the old bio lecture
[2017/09/01, 08:34:06] Luc Hayward: Actually ill print my chemistry prac
[2017/09/01, 08:35:52] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'll meet you in the bio lecture theatre
[2017/09/01, 22:10:10] Stuart Mesham: Did you say you wanted a lift in tomorrow?
[2017/09/01, 22:10:48] Stuart Mesham: Dan says he's going via Bishops so we'll have to leave here a bit earlier (around 9:20) if you're coming with us
[2017/09/01, 22:11:57] Stuart Mesham: And then also Dan's tutoring in the afternoon so he might be using the car at the time we finish so I might be a bit unreliable if you want a lift back
[2017/09/02, 00:19:37] Luc Hayward: Nah no stress I slept at the Kane's tonight
[2017/09/02, 08:20:57] Stuart Mesham: Ah ok
[2017/09/02, 08:45:00] Luc Hayward: Might run an itsy bit late today
[2017/09/02, 10:03:32] Luc Hayward: Ok where the fuck do I go
[2017/09/02, 10:11:48] Stuart Mesham: Also only getting here now
[2017/09/02, 10:11:48] Stuart Mesham: Did you find it?
[2017/09/02, 10:18:23] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/09/02, 18:17:04] Stuart Mesham: Do you have Proof of the identities for the integrals of odd and even functions?
[2017/09/02, 18:29:50] Luc Hayward: Ask faith
[2017/09/03, 12:56:42] Luc Hayward: Ew exam timetable is out
[2017/09/03, 12:58:53] Stuart Mesham: Oh no ew
[2017/09/03, 12:59:11] Stuart Mesham: Already
[2017/09/03, 12:59:22] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/09/03, 12:59:32] Luc Hayward: we finish on the 24th fo november which is sick
[2017/09/03, 12:59:39] Stuart Mesham: I don't like it
[2017/09/03, 12:59:53] Luc Hayward: your times will be different but you should write basically at the same sort of times to me
[2017/09/03, 13:00:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/03, 13:00:52] Luc Hayward: have you found all the proofs
[2017/09/03, 13:01:16] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/09/03, 13:01:31] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/03, 13:01:37] Stuart Mesham: Here's one from Faith
[2017/09/03, 13:11:42] Luc Hayward: there are like 9
[2017/09/03, 14:10:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah ew
[2017/09/03, 14:11:15] Luc Hayward: we only have 2
[2017/09/03, 14:11:38] Stuart Mesham: What's the second one we have? 😂
[2017/09/03, 15:14:28] Luc Hayward: we have one from mashudu
[2017/09/03, 15:14:33] Luc Hayward: remember webassign
[2017/09/03, 15:46:22] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/09/03, 15:47:02] Stuart Mesham: The long one with In? (that's a capital i)
[2017/09/03, 15:59:22] Luc Hayward: mybe
[2017/09/04, 16:34:37] Stuart Mesham: Finished! 🎉
[2017/09/04, 16:34:53] Luc Hayward: Gg come to engineering library and walk towards the back
[2017/09/04, 16:42:18] Luc Hayward: where you at
[2017/09/04, 16:45:54] Stuart Mesham: Let me in
[2017/09/04, 16:46:07] Luc Hayward: student card??
[2017/09/04, 17:13:46] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/04, 19:13:29] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/04, 19:18:13] Luc Hayward: How was it
[2017/09/04, 19:18:22] Stuart Mesham: Fine
[2017/09/04, 19:18:43] Stuart Mesham: Does concat return or modify? 🤔
[2017/09/04, 19:19:17] Stuart Mesham: Also the multiple choice with %-9.2f (I think) none of the answers looked right
[2017/09/04, 19:21:56] Luc Hayward: Fuck didn't even think about that.
[2017/09/04, 19:22:05] Luc Hayward: One was right I think
[2017/09/04, 19:22:14] Stuart Mesham: d?
[2017/09/04, 19:22:21] Luc Hayward: R1234.56 .
[2017/09/04, 19:22:26] Luc Hayward: Think so
[2017/09/04, 19:22:37] Stuart Mesham: Ok I went that one
[2017/09/04, 19:22:46] Luc Hayward: I dno actually. I said the answer was aaabbb
[2017/09/04, 19:22:53] Stuart Mesham: But it's only 8 characters
[2017/09/04, 19:23:03] Stuart Mesham: I said aaa
[2017/09/04, 19:23:16] Stuart Mesham: Also the weird for loop thing
[2017/09/04, 19:23:32] Stuart Mesham: Did you say it worked or nah? 😄
[2017/09/04, 19:25:40] Luc Hayward: This is correct, strings are immutable
[2017/09/04, 19:26:00] Luc Hayward: I think there was one that worked
[2017/09/04, 19:26:07] Luc Hayward: What which one ?
[2017/09/04, 19:26:36] Luc Hayward: Pretty sure I said it worked but I don't actually remember the question you mean
[2017/09/04, 19:28:06] Stuart Mesham: I also said it worked
[2017/09/04, 19:28:15] Stuart Mesham: It does work
[2017/09/04, 19:28:29] Luc Hayward: On
[2017/09/04, 19:28:31] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/09/04, 19:28:34] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/04, 19:28:56] Luc Hayward: Is ready to murder the snorting guy
[2017/09/04, 19:29:02] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/09/04, 19:29:07] Luc Hayward: Oh yeah that one I agreed
[2017/09/04, 19:29:33] Stuart Mesham: I didn't even notice the snorting guy
[2017/09/04, 19:29:56] Stuart Mesham: I was writing at high speed 😄
[2017/09/04, 19:29:59] Luc Hayward: It killed me
[2017/09/04, 19:30:44] Stuart Mesham: Also did you notice that in the last question (toString) that in the first example the price had 2 decimal places and in the second one it had 1 decimal place?
[2017/09/04, 19:30:59] Luc Hayward: I did not
[2017/09/04, 19:31:02] Luc Hayward: At all
[2017/09/04, 19:31:08] Luc Hayward: I didn't bother trying to be fancy
[2017/09/04, 19:31:31] Luc Hayward: I just said to use the price variable. No rounding out formatting
[2017/09/04, 19:31:42] Stuart Mesham: I saw that in the last 2 minutes and wrote an if statement around my return thing going if(price <0) else 🙈
[2017/09/04, 19:31:49] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/09/04, 19:31:58] Luc Hayward: Literally didn't see it at all
[2017/09/04, 19:32:04] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/09/04, 19:33:45] Luc Hayward: Oh well
[2017/09/04, 20:13:30] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/04, 20:14:59] Stuart Mesham: Aaah good effort steve 😂
[2017/09/04, 20:15:23] Stuart Mesham: He's one of the bishops guys that once sat next to us in comp sci
[2017/09/04, 20:15:48] Stuart Mesham: I don't think he's planning on protesting
[2017/09/04, 20:16:06] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/09/04, 20:16:19] Luc Hayward: Was more interested in shocks response
[2017/09/04, 20:20:11] Stuart Mesham: Yeah, sad, isn't it
[2017/09/04, 20:21:35] Stuart Mesham: Studying Comp sci questions on Quizlet: https://quizlet.com/220900663/comp-sci-questions-flash-cards/
[2017/09/04, 20:21:48] Stuart Mesham: Password is banana
[2017/09/04, 20:22:04] Stuart Mesham: Just in case we need it for the final exam
[2017/09/04, 20:30:26] Luc Hayward: Thanks
[2017/09/06, 08:55:13] Luc Hayward: You at varsity?
[2017/09/06, 08:55:41] Stuart Mesham: Nah
[2017/09/06, 08:55:58] Stuart Mesham: Is there any protest action?
[2017/09/06, 08:56:18] Luc Hayward: Nah you may as well be here
[2017/09/06, 09:00:49] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm still just coming for bio though
[2017/09/06, 09:01:09] Stuart Mesham: I still haven't finished this infernal Chem prac report
[2017/09/06, 09:01:21] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/09/06, 09:18:12] Stuart Mesham: Can you help me with chemistry after maths?
[2017/09/06, 09:18:43] Stuart Mesham: I have no idea how to answer these last questions on the prac report
[2017/09/06, 09:30:32] Luc Hayward: Yeah come to varsity
[2017/09/06, 09:39:00] Stuart Mesham: I'll come at 11
[2017/09/06, 09:39:14] Luc Hayward: So after maths
[2017/09/06, 09:39:32] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/06, 10:57:41] Luc Hayward: Engineering libraty
[2017/09/06, 11:08:00] Stuart Mesham: Why?????
[2017/09/06, 11:09:34] Luc Hayward: couch
[2017/09/06, 11:50:35] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/06, 16:43:49] Luc Hayward: where you at? you left for bio and never came back xD
[2017/09/06, 16:50:55] Stuart Mesham: Oh I went straight back to res
[2017/09/06, 16:51:02] Stuart Mesham: Been cramming hard
[2017/09/06, 16:56:58] Luc Hayward: Don’t feel like I got anywhere
[2017/09/06, 16:58:58] Stuart Mesham: I keep feeling like "ok this time I've got it" when I try and example and then I get it very wrong 😵
[2017/09/06, 16:59:42] Luc Hayward: I’ve started the proofs again but they aren’t intuitive
[2017/09/06, 17:00:10] Luc Hayward: Like ftc1 has three ways of doing it that are all the same but slightly different in the writing
[2017/09/06, 17:09:19] Stuart Mesham: I gave up on the proofs
[2017/09/06, 17:09:31] Stuart Mesham: Just did lots and lots of examples
[2017/09/06, 17:30:59] Stuart Mesham: Raat let's get this show on the road
[2017/09/06, 17:31:08] Stuart Mesham: Get ready to get rekt
[2017/09/06, 20:20:20] Luc Hayward: I should have just started home and gotten the average
[2017/09/06, 20:38:26] Stuart Mesham: 100% with you there
[2017/09/06, 20:45:01] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/09/06, 20:45:04] Luc Hayward: You don't understand
[2017/09/06, 20:45:08] Luc Hayward: I feel like death
[2017/09/06, 20:45:21] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/06, 20:45:44] Luc Hayward: You know when you read a book LTE at night and find yourself rereading the same line like 3 times ?
[2017/09/06, 20:45:48] Luc Hayward: Whole test
[2017/09/06, 20:51:31] Stuart Mesham: Oh shit
[2017/09/06, 20:51:40] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it was a kak one
[2017/09/06, 21:18:38] Stuart Mesham: Hey Lloyd's coming to UCT tomorrow
[2017/09/07, 06:41:44] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/09/07, 06:41:50] Luc Hayward: What time
[2017/09/07, 07:13:54] Luc Hayward: Forgot to collect for you there are two handouts for chem
[2017/09/07, 07:46:48] Stuart Mesham: Oh never mind he said he'd rather come on Friday when there's no rain
[2017/09/07, 07:47:13] Stuart Mesham: Don't worry, I'll find them upstairs
[2017/09/07, 07:52:26] Luc Hayward: Ah right. It's raining on Friday too
[2017/09/07, 07:56:04] Stuart Mesham: Oh shame 😂
[2017/09/07, 07:56:40] Stuart Mesham: Can you send me a pic of the front page of the Chem notes so I can find them when I get there?
[2017/09/07, 07:56:54] Luc Hayward: It's on acids and bases
[2017/09/07, 07:57:16] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks
[2017/09/07, 13:36:26] Luc Hayward: Ay can you help me with Chem tomorrow?
[2017/09/07, 13:55:33] Luc Hayward: Like with what to do ?
[2017/09/07, 13:53:20] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/09/07, 13:53:23] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/09/07, 13:54:30] Stuart Mesham: Just so you know, I still don't know if my answers are right. I just gave up and handed in what I had. 🤷🏻‍♂
[2017/09/07, 13:56:20] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/09/07, 13:56:32] Stuart Mesham: The calculations
[2017/09/07, 13:56:34] Luc Hayward: I have literally no idea wtf to do.
[2017/09/07, 13:56:56] Stuart Mesham: For the pre-prac?
[2017/09/07, 13:57:16] Luc Hayward: Nah prepare I managed
[2017/09/07, 13:57:16] Stuart Mesham: Wait are you at your prac now?
[2017/09/07, 13:57:25] Luc Hayward: Theyre late
[2017/09/07, 13:57:47] Luc Hayward: Yeah preprac I did but I couldn't answer why it happens fast and not gradually
[2017/09/07, 13:58:30] Luc Hayward: And I looked at the report
[2017/09/07, 13:58:36] Stuart Mesham: Oh it's because reaction 2 happens way faster than reaction 1
[2017/09/07, 13:58:37] Luc Hayward: Thats confusing af
[2017/09/07, 13:58:56] Stuart Mesham: And reaction 2 uses up the I produced by reaction 1
[2017/09/07, 13:59:01] Luc Hayward: But once reaction two is over then only do we see stuff occurring
[2017/09/07, 13:59:35] Luc Hayward: Oh so it happens rapidly and rapidly stupid reacting?  But reaction one still produces I2 slowly doesn't it
[2017/09/07, 13:59:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah because normally the I produced by 1 is instantly used by 2 so as soon as 2 stops then suddenly there is I everywhere from 1
[2017/09/07, 14:00:01] Luc Hayward: Oh ok
[2017/09/07, 14:00:07] Luc Hayward: Makes sense
[2017/09/07, 14:00:47] Stuart Mesham: Also you do the prac in pairs so just get a partner who knows what's cracking 😂
[2017/09/07, 14:00:58] Luc Hayward: Oh really ? Fuck yes
[2017/09/07, 14:01:14] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I was also quite happy about that 😂
[2017/09/07, 14:01:17] Luc Hayward: There's two that I want so I hope they don't go together
[2017/09/07, 14:01:25] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/09/07, 15:38:20] Luc Hayward: Whether how do
[2017/09/07, 15:38:24] Luc Hayward: Alright*
[2017/09/07, 15:46:58] Stuart Mesham: Wot wot
[2017/09/07, 15:51:14] Luc Hayward: how do chemistry wut
[2017/09/07, 15:51:21] Luc Hayward: first off
[2017/09/07, 15:51:28] Luc Hayward: what is log(1/t)
[2017/09/07, 15:51:36] Luc Hayward: and why am I graphing against it
[2017/09/07, 15:53:59] Luc Hayward: like i have all my values for the table, and I filled in my time values (so now just have to fill concentrations)... but log1/6 is a negative
[2017/09/07, 15:54:00] Stuart Mesham: I dunno, i just accepted
[2017/09/07, 15:54:23] Stuart Mesham: That's right it's supposed to be negative
[2017/09/07, 15:54:35] Luc Hayward: its meant to be negative?
[2017/09/07, 15:54:41] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/09/07, 15:54:58] Stuart Mesham: But you should have a positive gradient for both your graphs if you put time on the y-axis
[2017/09/07, 15:55:17] Luc Hayward: yeah i have to work out the concentration of I- and H2)2
[2017/09/07, 15:55:22] Luc Hayward: H2O2*
[2017/09/07, 15:55:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/07, 15:56:05] Stuart Mesham: But you graph log of the concentrations
[2017/09/07, 15:56:15] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/09/07, 15:56:52] Luc Hayward: does this look rightish?
[2017/09/07, 15:56:51] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/07, 15:57:10] Luc Hayward: volume added *0.1 * 0.05
[2017/09/07, 15:58:14] Luc Hayward: yeah thats right i think
[2017/09/07, 15:58:46] Stuart Mesham: Show me the formula?
[2017/09/07, 15:59:37] Luc Hayward: the volume of H2O2*0.1*0.05
[2017/09/07, 15:59:52] Stuart Mesham: Nooo
[2017/09/07, 16:00:00] Luc Hayward: what should it be?
[2017/09/07, 16:00:22] Stuart Mesham: You gotta convert to dm3
[2017/09/07, 16:00:51] Luc Hayward: yeah?
[2017/09/07, 16:00:51] Stuart Mesham: And then work out moles of H2O2
[2017/09/07, 16:00:52] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/09/07, 16:00:57] Luc Hayward: volumes all in dm3
[2017/09/07, 16:01:11] Stuart Mesham: And then divide by the total volume of the solution
[2017/09/07, 16:01:26] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/09/07, 16:01:28] Luc Hayward: sooo
[2017/09/07, 16:01:55] Stuart Mesham: Well that's what I did, I can't guarantee that it's right
[2017/09/07, 16:03:17] Luc Hayward: Volume (H2O2/1000)*0.1/(50/1000)?
[2017/09/07, 16:03:01] Stuart Mesham: Hold on, gonna go wash stuff, I'll be 15 min
[2017/09/07, 16:03:49] Luc Hayward: that is volume h2o2 in dm3 * original conecntration of 0.1M / total volume of solution in dm3
[2017/09/07, 16:03:50] Luc Hayward: kk
[2017/09/07, 16:04:15] Luc Hayward: you can show me tomorrow maybe after maths? I have so much I have this and compsci and stats due tomorrow all at the same kind of time
[2017/09/07, 16:05:25] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/07, 16:12:27] Luc Hayward: Theoretically we have the same concentrations
[2017/09/07, 16:16:03] Stuart Mesham: Yeah this is what I've got
[2017/09/07, 16:16:24] Luc Hayward: Ok were can look tomorrow?
[2017/09/07, 16:23:21] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/07, 16:44:01] Luc Hayward: Why are graphs so fucking hard to do on excel
[2017/09/07, 16:44:10] Luc Hayward: I just want a fucking line graph
[2017/09/07, 17:14:56] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah that
[2017/09/07, 17:15:12] Stuart Mesham: I spent too much time trying to make excel draw a graph
[2017/09/07, 17:15:27] Stuart Mesham: Turns out you have to use the scatter plot preset
[2017/09/07, 17:19:15] Luc Hayward: yep
[2017/09/07, 17:19:17] Luc Hayward: whores
[2017/09/07, 17:19:21] Luc Hayward: ok i think i got it
[2017/09/07, 17:26:44] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/07, 17:33:43] Luc Hayward: So I have that graph
[2017/09/07, 17:34:07] Luc Hayward: nvm
[2017/09/07, 17:40:06] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/07, 17:40:09] Stuart Mesham: This was mine
[2017/09/07, 17:40:57] Luc Hayward: so did you say it was 1sr order in both ?
[2017/09/07, 17:41:28] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/07, 17:56:25] Luc Hayward: When I calculte the initial rates (question 2), it says to use delta[H2O2] and then gives the hint about how it is related to the concentration of thiosulphate (S2O3).....but we dont know that concentration and we already know the concentration of the peroxide so can we just use that
[2017/09/07, 18:00:21] Stuart Mesham: This was one of the questions I still have no idea about
[2017/09/07, 18:00:31] Luc Hayward: Right
[2017/09/07, 18:00:33] Luc Hayward: Fuck it
[2017/09/07, 18:00:59] Stuart Mesham: The guy that I was ppagiarising with and I had completely different answers and we couldn't figure out what we were supposed to do
[2017/09/07, 18:01:08] Luc Hayward: oh well
[2017/09/07, 18:01:08] Stuart Mesham: That's what we did 😂
[2017/09/07, 18:01:29] Luc Hayward: maybe just take a quick peek at mine tomorrow and if nothing screams wrong then I'll hand in and not care
[2017/09/07, 18:01:32] Stuart Mesham: We just handed in and went "oh well" 🤷🏻‍♂😂
[2017/09/07, 18:01:45] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/09/07, 21:19:19] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/07, 21:20:07] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/07, 21:47:25] Stuart Mesham: Never mind I was just being dumb
[2017/09/07, 21:47:41] Stuart Mesham: Misread something in the question
[2017/09/08, 07:30:26] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/09/08, 07:30:47] Luc Hayward: What did you miss?
[2017/09/08, 07:47:07] Stuart Mesham: It's so annoying
[2017/09/08, 07:48:08] Stuart Mesham: getLongest is meant to return the index of the jump
[2017/09/08, 07:48:10] Stuart Mesham: But starting at 1 and not 0
[2017/09/08, 07:48:20] Luc Hayward: Wtf
[2017/09/08, 07:48:21] Luc Hayward: Why
[2017/09/08, 07:48:52] Stuart Mesham: And the other 2 getIsFalseJump and get Jump distance also start at 1
[2017/09/08, 07:49:33] Luc Hayward: I would post on the chat about that because that's just wrong. If it's intended for programmers it should start at 0. Unless they are storing it as 3 separate variables
[2017/09/08, 07:50:19] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I think maybe that's what they wanted because I don't think the class has learnt arrays yet
[2017/09/08, 07:51:20] Stuart Mesham: Still really annoying though 😑
[2017/09/08, 07:59:18] Luc Hayward: Mm
[2017/09/08, 14:59:44] Luc Hayward: must I check that if I havent yet recorded jump 2, the distance is the default value of -1?>
[2017/09/08, 15:00:09] Stuart Mesham: No you don't have to
[2017/09/08, 15:00:22] Luc Hayward: ok I just ignore unrecorded values
[2017/09/08, 15:00:46] Stuart Mesham: Actually you mustn't check because some of the tests give index out of bounds if you do
[2017/09/08, 15:00:55] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/08, 15:01:03] Luc Hayward: ok starting now, can blaze this in 2 hours
[2017/09/08, 15:01:14] Stuart Mesham: Ok good luck 😂
[2017/09/08, 15:01:26] Stuart Mesham: ⚡
[2017/09/08, 15:01:32] Luc Hayward: you might get lots of messages to cut down on bug fixing❤❤
[2017/09/08, 15:01:43] Stuart Mesham: Ok 😂
[2017/09/08, 15:24:07] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/08, 15:25:25] Stuart Mesham: Idk just submitted the first part you have 101 attempts 😂
[2017/09/08, 15:25:48] Stuart Mesham: *just submit
[2017/09/08, 15:26:04] Luc Hayward: gonna write the whole thing first
[2017/09/08, 15:26:16] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/09/08, 15:31:57] Luc Hayward: can max jumps ever be more than 3
[2017/09/08, 15:32:05] Luc Hayward: or is it always 3
[2017/09/08, 15:32:20] Stuart Mesham: Always 3
[2017/09/08, 15:32:35] Luc Hayward: k
[2017/09/08, 16:16:13] Luc Hayward: did you write your TestAccount.java as a series of tests raturn pass or fail or did you write it as an example program
[2017/09/08, 16:16:21] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/08, 16:16:55] Stuart Mesham: Nah I did it as a series of tests
[2017/09/08, 16:17:12] Luc Hayward: ok I'll change, couldn't tell if that was how they wanted it
[2017/09/08, 16:32:44] Luc Hayward: omg
[2017/09/08, 16:32:49] Luc Hayward: so many errors
[2017/09/08, 16:33:04] Luc Hayward: also struuuuugling to submit all the fuckers waited to the last minute again
[2017/09/08, 16:33:34] Luc Hayward: actually
[2017/09/08, 16:33:36] Luc Hayward: scratch that
[2017/09/08, 16:33:36] Stuart Mesham: It's ok, they extended the deadline to tomorrow already 😂
[2017/09/08, 16:33:40] Luc Hayward: might have no errors
[2017/09/08, 16:33:43] Luc Hayward: cant fucking submit
[2017/09/08, 16:34:01] Luc Hayward: finally
[2017/09/08, 16:34:03] Stuart Mesham: It takes time
[2017/09/08, 16:34:46] Luc Hayward: also where did they say this i havent seen anyhting
[2017/09/08, 16:35:04] Stuart Mesham: Email from Stephan just now
[2017/09/08, 16:35:38] Luc Hayward: ah is ee
[2017/09/08, 16:35:39] Luc Hayward: well
[2017/09/08, 16:35:45] Luc Hayward: I got a total of 43 first rry
[2017/09/08, 16:36:11] Luc Hayward: ah
[2017/09/08, 16:36:17] Luc Hayward: apparently
[2017/09/08, 16:36:31] Luc Hayward: my first one (the testing stuff) isnt compiling....
[2017/09/08, 16:37:04] Stuart Mesham: Did you make the class + main method public?
[2017/09/08, 16:37:28] Luc Hayward: changed a name in something and forgot to change it in the constructor
[2017/09/08, 16:40:23] Luc Hayward: trying again
[2017/09/08, 16:41:03] Luc Hayward: god damnit
[2017/09/08, 16:41:34] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/08, 16:48:39] Luc Hayward: Oh wow he really extended it
[2017/09/08, 17:00:49] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/08, 17:01:29] Luc Hayward: so confused where I'm going wrong
[2017/09/08, 17:01:50] Stuart Mesham: Still the same error?
[2017/09/08, 17:01:58] Luc Hayward: hasn't changed
[2017/09/08, 17:02:48] Stuart Mesham: What's line 70? + Line 44?
[2017/09/08, 17:03:07] Luc Hayward: line 44?
[2017/09/08, 17:03:23] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/08, 17:03:29] Luc Hayward: line 70 is in their gold standar, trying to see what is causing the index out of bounds i think its maybe the problem you had
[2017/09/08, 17:04:04] Stuart Mesham: No line 70 and 44 are in your testjumprecord
[2017/09/08, 17:04:36] Luc Hayward: ok new errors then
[2017/09/08, 17:04:48] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/08, 17:05:24] Stuart Mesham: What's at line 81 and line 22?
[2017/09/08, 17:05:33] Stuart Mesham: *21
[2017/09/08, 17:05:56] Luc Hayward: the i+1 was an i, changing it to test
[2017/09/08, 17:10:30] Luc Hayward: didnt help just chenged the error
[2017/09/08, 17:11:00] Stuart Mesham: Send me a pic of the line/s?
[2017/09/08, 17:11:44] Luc Hayward: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8uMx2tv05SbdUI3YzR5dWNvTVU?usp=sharing
[2017/09/08, 17:12:42] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/08, 17:12:50] Luc Hayward: ok so it fixed the our of bounds error
[2017/09/08, 17:12:57] Luc Hayward: now it's failing too many tests
[2017/09/08, 17:13:06] Luc Hayward: no idea how to fix that
[2017/09/08, 17:13:07] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/09/08, 17:13:47] Luc Hayward: But it HAS TO be fixed because at the moment my mark is 43
[2017/09/08, 17:14:05] Stuart Mesham: Hold on Dan's picking me up I'll check when I get home
[2017/09/08, 17:14:10] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/09/08, 18:18:32] Stuart Mesham: Sup I'm back
[2017/09/08, 18:18:37] Luc Hayward: sup
[2017/09/08, 18:18:48] Luc Hayward: I fixed it keegan point out some stupid typos
[2017/09/08, 18:19:03] Stuart Mesham: Oh nice
[2017/09/08, 18:19:26] Luc Hayward: getting 99% now, just not detecting one error in recordFoulJump() but I might leave it because like it will average out to 100
[2017/09/08, 18:19:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah just Yolo it
[2017/09/08, 18:20:23] Luc Hayward: just going to comment up and make pretty the one that they manrk by hand and call it da day,
[2017/09/08, 18:22:04] Stuart Mesham: I wrote javadocs on some of the methods so they can't _possibly_ complain that it's hard to understand what they do
[2017/09/08, 18:22:13] Luc Hayward: xD
[2017/09/08, 18:22:32] Stuart Mesham: Hopefully 😆
[2017/09/09, 09:20:35] Stuart Mesham: Oh bio's only tomorrow
[2017/09/09, 09:20:40] Stuart Mesham: So I am coming today
[2017/09/09, 09:34:54] Luc Hayward: Ay ok
[2017/09/09, 09:34:58] Luc Hayward: I'll see you there then
[2017/09/09, 11:47:49] Stuart Mesham: How close are you?
[2017/09/09, 13:16:22] Luc Hayward: Very
[2017/09/09, 19:58:02] Stuart Mesham: Have you been to Dalebrook beach?
[2017/09/09, 21:38:02] Luc Hayward: Yeah it's near my house
[2017/09/09, 21:38:40] Stuart Mesham: Is it hard to park there or should I just take the bus from UCT?
[2017/09/09, 21:39:13] Luc Hayward: Nah drive lad. Should find parking and if you don't it's like less than a km from my road and like 500m from tigers
[2017/09/09, 21:39:55] Stuart Mesham: Ok awesome
[2017/09/09, 21:40:11] Stuart Mesham: Do you recommend hectic jersey power? 😂
[2017/09/09, 21:41:11] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/09, 22:48:11] Luc Hayward: U think you'll be fine
[2017/09/09, 22:48:23] Luc Hayward: It's a beach I recommend being prepped to take those shoes off
[2017/09/09, 22:48:42] Luc Hayward: Bring a light Jersey if it's windy but I can tell you when I'm up
[2017/09/09, 22:48:54] Luc Hayward: If you realise you need anything just yell you can get from me
[2017/09/10, 08:31:30] Stuart Mesham: Ok awesome thanks
[2017/09/10, 11:02:20] Stuart Mesham: Hell yeah, did my first parallel park... nailed it 😎 😂
[2017/09/10, 17:35:07] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/10, 21:45:39] Luc Hayward: Ye
[2017/09/11, 09:38:57] Luc Hayward: You did watch forest hump right? It's Lt Dan!
[2017/09/12, 10:36:52] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/12, 10:36:56] Stuart Mesham: 2015 test 1
[2017/09/12, 15:57:00] Stuart Mesham: Is there a comp sci prac test this week?
[2017/09/12, 15:57:07] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/09/12, 15:57:37] Stuart Mesham: Oh lol, I just came to the lab 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/09/12, 16:07:02] Luc Hayward: You knob ours would only be tomorrow anyway
[2017/09/12, 18:32:50] Stuart Mesham: No I was gonna go today and study for bio tomorrow
[2017/09/12, 18:33:38] Stuart Mesham: As an aside, I'm not coming tomorrow
[2017/09/12, 18:33:42] Stuart Mesham: Only to bio
[2017/09/13, 10:47:14] Luc Hayward: How long was the prac yesterday?
[2017/09/13, 10:48:00] Stuart Mesham: If you get into a massive group you can do it _really_ fast
[2017/09/13, 10:48:08] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/09/13, 10:48:18] Luc Hayward: So how long is the prac😂
[2017/09/13, 10:48:42] Stuart Mesham: 1 hour 20 min for me?
[2017/09/13, 10:48:48] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/09/13, 13:41:17] Stuart Mesham: They also marked my constructor answer wrong!!!!
[2017/09/13, 13:41:34] Stuart Mesham: This is why we need query sessions
[2017/09/13, 13:41:53] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/13, 14:19:50] Stuart Mesham: Did you get question 2 right?
[2017/09/13, 14:57:09] Stuart Mesham: Nvm, the memo is up
[2017/09/13, 14:57:21] Stuart Mesham: I still disagree though
[2017/09/13, 14:57:40] Stuart Mesham: It doesn't compile because s isn't static
[2017/09/13, 17:04:11] Luc Hayward: Hmm? What?
[2017/09/13, 17:05:05] Luc Hayward: yes
[2017/09/13, 17:05:43] Luc Hayward: yes yes will query it tomorrow asap
[2017/09/13, 17:06:27] Luc Hayward: what questions is this
[2017/09/13, 17:06:50] Stuart Mesham: Question 2
[2017/09/13, 17:07:02] Luc Hayward: of the paper or of the multiple choice
[2017/09/13, 17:07:10] Stuart Mesham: Yee let's go query
[2017/09/13, 17:07:19] Stuart Mesham: Of the multiple choice
[2017/09/13, 17:07:31] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/13, 17:07:43] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/13, 17:07:54] Luc Hayward: it says null
[2017/09/13, 17:08:07] Stuart Mesham: No I tested it, it doesn't compile
[2017/09/13, 17:08:23] Luc Hayward: it wants s to be static?
[2017/09/13, 17:08:49] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/13, 17:09:45] Stuart Mesham: But they say d in the memo
[2017/09/13, 17:10:10] Luc Hayward: weird
[2017/09/13, 17:10:19] Luc Hayward: go show them that very quietly then
[2017/09/13, 17:10:37] Stuart Mesham: Yeah so they change mine and not yours 😂
[2017/09/13, 17:10:43] Luc Hayward: exactly
[2017/09/13, 17:10:47] Luc Hayward: otherwise what did you get
[2017/09/13, 17:10:53] Stuart Mesham: I don't think they'll change it though
[2017/09/13, 17:10:57] Stuart Mesham: 27
[2017/09/13, 17:11:04] Luc Hayward: nice
[2017/09/13, 17:11:04] Stuart Mesham: But I wanna get full marks 😂
[2017/09/13, 17:11:10] Luc Hayward: and after changing things?
[2017/09/13, 17:11:17] Stuart Mesham: I think 30
[2017/09/13, 17:11:20] Luc Hayward: would you get 100 if they gave you what you think you should get?
[2017/09/13, 17:11:28] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/13, 17:11:31] Luc Hayward: so what one mark there and one mark in the constructor questions?
[2017/09/13, 17:11:55] Stuart Mesham: And one mark in the toString but I also tested mine and it worked
[2017/09/13, 17:12:21] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/13, 17:12:44] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/13, 17:12:48] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/13, 17:12:59] Luc Hayward: It does say appropriate so I don't blame them taking a mark off for being excessively complicated
[2017/09/13, 17:13:44] Luc Hayward: 3 marks for a toString is too much its only worth two so maybe one mark is for not doing it like a knob
[2017/09/13, 17:14:01] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/09/13, 17:14:05] Stuart Mesham: Maybe
[2017/09/13, 17:14:51] Luc Hayward: bleak you're going to beat me by 1 mark now maybe even 2
[2017/09/13, 17:14:59] Stuart Mesham: But you wouldn't want your toString to output "name: Harry Potter, price: R23.48488888888888888888, author: j k Rowling 😂
[2017/09/13, 17:15:06] Luc Hayward: trying to do the chemistry but I'm struuugling
[2017/09/13, 17:15:34] Stuart Mesham: Fuck I'm trying to do bio and also struuuuugling 😂
[2017/09/13, 17:15:46] Luc Hayward: But this can never ever happen because there is no possible way to change the price haha
[2017/09/13, 17:15:48] Stuart Mesham: I'm about half way
[2017/09/13, 17:15:55] Luc Hayward: so you can't having floating piont error
[2017/09/13, 17:16:14] Stuart Mesham: You can put any price into the constructor
[2017/09/13, 17:16:14] Luc Hayward: I'm on Q5c and totally lost
[2017/09/13, 17:16:31] Luc Hayward: in which case that is the correct price and you want to know it
[2017/09/13, 17:16:50] Stuart Mesham: You gotta be prepped for all possible input, it's called defensive programming 😂
[2017/09/13, 17:17:02] Stuart Mesham: You gotta assume the user is a knob
[2017/09/13, 17:17:48] Stuart Mesham: And who knows, maybe they want 23 rand to be R23.00 and not R23.0
[2017/09/13, 17:17:56] Luc Hayward: then you should also be testing that the price of the book wasnt "donkeylover99"
[2017/09/13, 17:18:04] Stuart Mesham: But we wouldn't know because they only gave 2 examples
[2017/09/13, 17:18:28] Stuart Mesham: No they'd get a compiler error so it wouldn't be our problem 😂
[2017/09/13, 17:18:51] Luc Hayward: I dno I wouldn't give it to you but maybe
[2017/09/13, 17:19:09] Stuart Mesham: I would give it to me 😉
[2017/09/13, 17:19:20] Stuart Mesham: So I'm hoping they will 😂
[2017/09/13, 17:19:33] Luc Hayward: hahah
[2017/09/13, 17:19:43] Luc Hayward: fuckj this section of chem i don;t get it
[2017/09/13, 17:20:19] Stuart Mesham: My case: they only gave 2 examples so anything that fits those 2 should be accepted
[2017/09/13, 17:20:24] Luc Hayward: Also I somehow have to finish chem by tomorrow morning, stats assignment by thursday 5pm and comp sci assignment by 2:40pm on friday (and I have a test from 1pm)
[2017/09/13, 17:20:51] Stuart Mesham: When in doubt, ICE cream! 🍦😀
[2017/09/13, 17:21:18] Stuart Mesham: Oh crap the comp sci assignment 😂
[2017/09/13, 17:21:31] Stuart Mesham: Guess I'm skipping lectures on Friday too them
[2017/09/13, 17:21:39] Luc Hayward: I'm so fucking fucked
[2017/09/13, 17:22:03] Stuart Mesham: All the wheels have truly come off this time 😂
[2017/09/13, 17:22:09] Luc Hayward: I have three hours on saturday where Hol is doing a school thing that I can use to catch up on lectures though soooo fuck I dont know how I'll finish
[2017/09/13, 17:22:17] Luc Hayward: Maths isnt recorded
[2017/09/13, 17:22:22] Luc Hayward: He's doing proofs tomorrow
[2017/09/13, 17:22:28] Stuart Mesham: Dafuq?
[2017/09/13, 17:22:36] Stuart Mesham: Since when?
[2017/09/13, 17:22:54] Luc Hayward: Maths has never been recorded in mashudus lecture only jono records
[2017/09/13, 17:23:09] Stuart Mesham: Not Jono's lectures either now?
[2017/09/13, 17:23:30] Stuart Mesham: Or can I just try find the appropriate one of Jono's lectures?
[2017/09/13, 17:23:40] Luc Hayward: jono recorsd
[2017/09/13, 17:23:49] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/09/13, 17:24:09] Stuart Mesham: Right cheers, gotta get back to the bio
[2017/09/13, 17:25:37] Luc Hayward: yeye
[2017/09/13, 18:12:45] Luc Hayward: giving up
[2017/09/13, 18:13:26] Stuart Mesham: Just put fake answers for the questions you don't know, that's what I did 😂
[2017/09/13, 18:13:38] Stuart Mesham: Ain't nobody got time for Chem tuts 😂
[2017/09/13, 18:13:39] Luc Hayward: I leave them as far as I get and then my group helps
[2017/09/13, 18:13:59] Stuart Mesham: Oh my tut person is really strict
[2017/09/13, 18:14:15] Stuart Mesham: She always checks how many we've done
[2017/09/13, 18:15:27] Luc Hayward: oh no my guy is so chill
[2017/09/13, 19:56:57] Luc Hayward: We need a team
[2017/09/13, 19:57:12] Luc Hayward: For the competition
[2017/09/13, 19:59:14] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah
[2017/09/13, 19:59:25] Luc Hayward: Will you organise that?
[2017/09/13, 19:59:25] Stuart Mesham: Let's sort it out on Friday
[2017/09/13, 19:59:35] Stuart Mesham: Not now
[2017/09/13, 20:00:10] Luc Hayward: Either all first years because you and I can probably win the best all first year local prize or else anyone who will take us
[2017/09/13, 20:01:03] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 👌🏻
[2017/09/13, 20:01:36] Stuart Mesham: Ok will set a reminder to think about this on Friday
[2017/09/13, 20:02:53] Luc Hayward: Lad
[2017/09/13, 21:42:10] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/13, 21:42:42] Luc Hayward: please tell me that is actually a part of the notes
[2017/09/13, 21:44:44] Stuart Mesham: It's the actual lecture slides 😂
[2017/09/13, 21:44:53] Luc Hayward: thats fucking golden
[2017/09/13, 21:45:05] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/09/13, 21:54:30] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/13, 21:55:08] Luc Hayward: Thats even better
[2017/09/13, 21:55:56] Stuart Mesham: He just doesn't stop 😂
[2017/09/13, 21:56:23] Luc Hayward: Can't stop Wont stop!
[2017/09/13, 21:57:47] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/09/13, 22:05:14] Luc Hayward: Can send others as you find them I love it
[2017/09/13, 22:21:56] Stuart Mesham: Haha sure
[2017/09/14, 14:31:54] Stuart Mesham: Hey Luc, can you send me Mike's number please?
[2017/09/14, 14:32:14] Stuart Mesham: Wait Mike is his name, right?
[2017/09/14, 14:32:42] Stuart Mesham: The guy who sometimes sits with us in Chem and does bio
[2017/09/14, 15:16:39] Luc Hayward: <‎Contact card omitted>
[2017/09/14, 15:16:46] Luc Hayward: Yeah michael
[2017/09/14, 15:18:51] Stuart Mesham: Is Mikki a nickname? 😂
[2017/09/14, 15:22:06] Luc Hayward: It's what he put in my phone
[2017/09/14, 15:22:28] Stuart Mesham: Ok 😂
[2017/09/14, 15:25:14] Luc Hayward: Are you in nlt
[2017/09/14, 15:25:35] Stuart Mesham: Nah I just went back to my room in the end
[2017/09/14, 15:25:40] Luc Hayward: Oh ok
[2017/09/14, 15:25:41] Stuart Mesham: I wanted food 😂
[2017/09/14, 19:18:13] Luc Hayward: Hope the test went well man
[2017/09/14, 19:19:03] Luc Hayward: Ugh the stupid automarker doesnt allow for us to use multiple constructors in our code because of the way it is testing things. IE I can't include a copy constructor because their version of the class against which we test doesn't use one
[2017/09/14, 19:53:38] Stuart Mesham: Thanks, I think it might actually have been fine 👍🏻
[2017/09/14, 19:54:08] Stuart Mesham: Ugh thanks
[2017/09/14, 20:11:07] Luc Hayward: Rather start on Q2 if you're doing any tonight
[2017/09/14, 20:11:13] Luc Hayward: I've done Q1
[2017/09/14, 20:11:41] Luc Hayward: And started Q2 so can help you with Q1 so it goes faster if needs be
[2017/09/14, 20:12:46] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks I'll get going on Q2 now. Most likely just going to take an early night though.
[2017/09/14, 20:27:06] Stuart Mesham: Is question 2 meant to be UML?
[2017/09/14, 20:31:24] Stuart Mesham: Nvm saw the Vula chat
[2017/09/15, 08:29:57] Stuart Mesham: Hey Luc, Happy Birthday! 🎉🎉🎁🎈
[2017/09/15, 08:36:31] Luc Hayward: Thanks man, I'll see you in nlt just after 9?
[2017/09/15, 08:37:38] Stuart Mesham: Yeah no Chem today?
[2017/09/15, 08:38:10] Stuart Mesham: I think there should be no Chem today 😂
[2017/09/15, 08:38:31] Luc Hayward: In nit going to Chem
[2017/09/15, 08:38:37] Luc Hayward: I'll watch the video tomorrow
[2017/09/15, 09:00:44] Stuart Mesham: I'm in the NLT
[2017/09/15, 09:01:04] Stuart Mesham: There's a stats lecture
[2017/09/15, 09:01:26] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/15, 09:01:41] Stuart Mesham: K
[2017/09/15, 09:11:59] Luc Hayward: I love cake Town
[2017/09/15, 09:12:35] Luc Hayward: Where you
[2017/09/15, 14:20:04] Luc Hayward: Was in the commerce building
[2017/09/15, 14:28:26] Stuart Mesham: It was the alumni lab, wasn't it? 😄
[2017/09/15, 14:28:53] Luc Hayward: No it was that big lab in Lesli social
[2017/09/15, 14:29:45] Stuart Mesham: Oh well now we know
[2017/09/15, 14:29:53] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/09/15, 14:29:58] Luc Hayward: Was piss
[2017/09/15, 14:30:38] Stuart Mesham: Naas, studying paid off 👌🏻
[2017/09/15, 15:39:48] Luc Hayward: Yessss
[2017/09/16, 10:04:17] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/18, 08:43:47] Luc Hayward: Dno if it's worth me coming to chemistry
[2017/09/18, 08:47:35] Stuart Mesham: Ah damn I'm late too
[2017/09/18, 08:47:36] Stuart Mesham: Only leaving res now
[2017/09/18, 08:52:01] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna go study in the library until maths
[2017/09/18, 09:00:08] Luc Hayward: Oh really?
[2017/09/18, 09:00:24] Luc Hayward: For chemistry?
[2017/09/18, 09:00:43] Luc Hayward: I can probably get there by like 9:15
[2017/09/18, 09:04:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/18, 09:05:57] Luc Hayward: Surely going to chemistry is smarter
[2017/09/18, 09:41:43] Stuart Mesham: Eh
[2017/09/19, 07:17:27] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/19, 16:45:21] Luc Hayward: ugh
[2017/09/19, 16:46:31] Luc Hayward: hvae you started a quizlet for this test?
[2017/09/19, 16:48:57] Stuart Mesham: Don't think we need to
[2017/09/19, 16:49:12] Stuart Mesham: Just doing lots of past papers
[2017/09/19, 16:49:15] Luc Hayward: how were pracs
[2017/09/19, 16:49:35] Stuart Mesham: Really chilled though it took a while
[2017/09/19, 16:50:04] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/09/19, 16:50:04] Stuart Mesham: Our report is only due on Thursday 👍🏻
[2017/09/19, 16:50:11] Luc Hayward: luckyyy
[2017/09/19, 16:50:15] Stuart Mesham: Lucky us
[2017/09/19, 16:50:27] Luc Hayward: I just finished going through the tuts that pertain to this test
[2017/09/19, 16:50:39] Luc Hayward: So tomorrow is going to be all past paper calculations
[2017/09/19, 16:50:49] Stuart Mesham: Oh does this week's tut?
[2017/09/19, 16:51:18] Luc Hayward: I think it might
[2017/09/19, 16:51:29] Luc Hayward: depends do you remember how far he said we had to go??
[2017/09/19, 16:51:41] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/09/19, 16:51:51] Luc Hayward: kak
[2017/09/19, 16:51:54] Stuart Mesham: He just said solutions is not in the test
[2017/09/19, 16:52:53] Luc Hayward: solutions....dont even remember what that involved
[2017/09/19, 16:52:58] Luc Hayward: bugfers?>
[2017/09/19, 16:53:00] Luc Hayward: buffer
[2017/09/19, 16:53:17] Stuart Mesham: I don't think so
[2017/09/19, 16:53:39] Stuart Mesham: I think it was that section to do with how solids don't affect concentration
[2017/09/19, 16:54:32] Luc Hayward: oh right I remember that
[2017/09/19, 16:54:38] Luc Hayward: there wasn't anyhting new really in that one
[2017/09/19, 16:54:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/19, 16:55:03] Stuart Mesham: I'm looking at Greg's email from yesterday
[2017/09/19, 16:55:31] Luc Hayward: does it say anything
[2017/09/19, 16:56:34] Stuart Mesham: Intermolecular forces
Phase changes
Solutions
(19 marks)

Chemical Equilibrium
Acid-Base Equilibria
(21 marks)
[2017/09/19, 16:57:09] Luc Hayward: saw that
[2017/09/19, 16:57:17] Luc Hayward: about half easy piss and half difficult stuff
[2017/09/19, 16:58:02] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/19, 16:59:38] Luc Hayward: Half siya half other dude
[2017/09/19, 17:00:14] Stuart Mesham: Can't even remember who the other guy was 😂
[2017/09/19, 17:01:24] Luc Hayward: little guy
[2017/09/19, 17:01:26] Luc Hayward: funny hair
[2017/09/19, 17:01:52] Stuart Mesham: Honestly no clue 😂
[2017/09/19, 17:24:02] Luc Hayward: there are 5 tuts
[2017/09/19, 17:24:15] Luc Hayward: i think the 5th is useful too
[2017/09/19, 17:27:52] Luc Hayward: definitely 4
[2017/09/19, 17:36:35] Stuart Mesham: Ok will have a look at them
[2017/09/19, 17:37:39] Stuart Mesham: I know you can just parrot learn them but I'm really struggling to understand this "number of atoms" and "number of neighbouring atoms" in the unit cell section
[2017/09/19, 17:38:20] Stuart Mesham: The section with simple cubic, body-centred cubic and face-centered cubic
[2017/09/19, 18:16:52] Stuart Mesham: https://quizlet.com/_3q6n14
[2017/09/19, 18:17:03] Stuart Mesham: Now I've made one
[2017/09/19, 18:17:07] Stuart Mesham: Password is banana
[2017/09/19, 18:23:42] Luc Hayward: sweet
[2017/09/19, 18:23:49] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/09/19, 18:23:50] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/09/19, 18:23:54] Luc Hayward: super easy to learn
[2017/09/19, 18:24:10] Luc Hayward: simple is 4 unit spheres, one at each corder
[2017/09/19, 18:24:36] Luc Hayward: body centered is a unit sphere surrounded by 4*1/4 unit spheres at each corner
[2017/09/19, 18:25:04] Luc Hayward: woops
[2017/09/19, 18:25:12] Stuart Mesham: But the coordination numbers
[2017/09/19, 18:26:07] Luc Hayward: one in the center and ... 1/8th at ea h corner
[2017/09/19, 18:25:50] Stuart Mesham: It's in lecture slides 12.3
[2017/09/19, 18:26:24] Luc Hayward: and then face centered is 6*1/2 plus 8*1/8
[2017/09/19, 18:26:56] Stuart Mesham: This is for atoms/unit cell though
[2017/09/19, 18:27:17] Stuart Mesham: The coordination number is the number of directly neighboring atoms
[2017/09/19, 18:27:29] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/09/19, 18:27:29] Stuart Mesham: But I can never picture it 😂
[2017/09/19, 18:27:30] Luc Hayward: hmm
[2017/09/19, 18:27:35] Luc Hayward: not sure what that means
[2017/09/19, 18:28:24] Stuart Mesham: Wait actually I just got it
[2017/09/19, 18:28:44] Stuart Mesham: It's really simple 🙈😂
[2017/09/19, 18:29:19] Stuart Mesham: Wait nope, nope broken again
[2017/09/19, 18:29:25] Luc Hayward: the first to (simple and Body centered i get)
[2017/09/19, 18:29:30] Luc Hayward: but the last one I can't see
[2017/09/19, 18:30:06] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/CsnNbuqxGTk
[2017/09/19, 18:32:42] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok got it
[2017/09/19, 18:33:27] Stuart Mesham: The coordination number means the neighbors for any single atom in a lattice with that structure (not neighbors of a single unit cell)
[2017/09/19, 18:38:49] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/09/19, 18:46:26] Stuart Mesham: I just did 1 past paper
[2017/09/19, 18:46:33] Stuart Mesham: It was a joke 😂
[2017/09/19, 18:46:47] Stuart Mesham: I'm now not stressed at all for this test
[2017/09/19, 18:48:18] Luc Hayward: Really?
[2017/09/19, 18:48:24] Luc Hayward: Which paper?
[2017/09/19, 18:48:39] Stuart Mesham: 2015
[2017/09/19, 18:48:48] Luc Hayward: Save one I just opened
[2017/09/19, 18:48:55] Luc Hayward: You know you have to do it in an hour
[2017/09/19, 18:49:00] Stuart Mesham: Just have a look at it before you spend too much time doing tuts
[2017/09/19, 18:49:03] Stuart Mesham: Chilled
[2017/09/19, 18:49:15] Luc Hayward: Ok I'll do it now
[2017/09/19, 18:49:14] Stuart Mesham: Really it's just using one formula per question
[2017/09/19, 18:49:22] Luc Hayward: Oh nice
[2017/09/19, 18:49:29] Luc Hayward: And the equilibrium things?
[2017/09/19, 18:49:34] Stuart Mesham: It's so easy
[2017/09/19, 18:49:36] Stuart Mesham: Even those
[2017/09/19, 18:49:51] Luc Hayward: Just use Ice tables?
[2017/09/19, 18:50:38] Stuart Mesham: Ok disclaimer I wasn't 100% sure that I used the right method for the rates questions but after I checked it turned out my method was right
[2017/09/19, 18:50:44] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/19, 18:50:51] Luc Hayward: cool
[2017/09/19, 18:51:15] Stuart Mesham: Even the questions where you have an answer and think "no it can't be that simple" it usually is 😄
[2017/09/19, 18:51:35] Luc Hayward: oh sweet
[2017/09/19, 18:52:06] Stuart Mesham: Yeah so don't stress too much about how difficult our tutorials were
[2017/09/19, 18:52:37] Luc Hayward: ok sweet
[2017/09/19, 18:52:53] Luc Hayward: I'll see you tomorrow for chemistry
[2017/09/19, 18:53:07] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/19, 18:58:50] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/19, 19:00:41] Stuart Mesham: They give you temp
[2017/09/19, 19:00:50] Stuart Mesham: At 25 C
[2017/09/19, 19:00:53] Luc Hayward: I can read
[2017/09/19, 19:00:56] Luc Hayward: ...sometimes
[2017/09/19, 19:01:10] Stuart Mesham: gg 😄
[2017/09/19, 19:01:59] Luc Hayward: which R is it?
[2017/09/19, 19:02:10] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/19, 19:03:38] Luc Hayward: foiund it
[2017/09/19, 19:03:14] Stuart Mesham: Because pressure's atm you use 0.082
[2017/09/19, 19:03:48] Stuart Mesham: There's another question to do with Kp where they don't give any pressure units and I just guessed 0.082 and it was right
[2017/09/19, 19:03:57] Stuart Mesham: So I think when in doubt use 0.082
[2017/09/19, 19:04:03] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/09/19, 19:04:43] Luc Hayward: can never tell whether they want 273.15 or 273 Kelvin per C
[2017/09/19, 19:05:18] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I usually just go with 273.15 as they can't complain if it's too accurate
[2017/09/19, 19:06:36] Stuart Mesham: The 2014 paper would get flagged for plagiarism
[2017/09/19, 19:08:21] Luc Hayward: why xd
[2017/09/19, 19:08:53] Stuart Mesham: The first half of it has the same questions with the same numbers and the answers are in the same order
[2017/09/19, 19:09:13] Luc Hayward: fuck yes boys
[2017/09/19, 19:09:16] Stuart Mesham: Actually 2015 would get flagged 🤔
[2017/09/19, 19:09:46] Stuart Mesham: I hope they keep the first half for our test as well 😄
[2017/09/19, 19:10:00] Stuart Mesham: That must be why they didn't put 2016 up
[2017/09/19, 19:10:09] Stuart Mesham: Because they plan to recycle it
[2017/09/19, 19:10:32] Luc Hayward: whores
[2017/09/19, 19:10:42] Luc Hayward: try find it in that past papers tab>??
[2017/09/19, 19:10:50] Stuart Mesham: Oooh
[2017/09/19, 19:11:53] Stuart Mesham: Nah it only goes up to 2016 january
[2017/09/19, 19:11:59] Luc Hayward: krk
[2017/09/19, 19:12:17] Stuart Mesham: Yeah useless 😄
[2017/09/19, 19:14:03] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/19, 19:14:08] Luc Hayward: Where does the 4 come from
[2017/09/19, 19:16:15] Stuart Mesham: 6*(1/2) (faces) + 8*(1/8) (corners) = 4
[2017/09/19, 19:31:06] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/19, 20:08:11] Luc Hayward: Don't think so
[2017/09/19, 20:31:36] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/19, 20:33:49] Luc Hayward: I actually have no clue
[2017/09/19, 20:34:11] Luc Hayward: I want to say b
[2017/09/19, 20:34:26] Stuart Mesham: I tried to look for it in the lecture notes but I couldn't find one like it
[2017/09/19, 20:34:42] Stuart Mesham: The answer is actually a
[2017/09/19, 20:35:09] Luc Hayward: I can't see how that works
[2017/09/19, 20:35:10] Stuart Mesham: I also have no idea
[2017/09/19, 20:36:12] Luc Hayward: 🦆
[2017/09/19, 20:36:21] Stuart Mesham: If you "use" a certain amount of pressure on the left do you "get" double that amount on the right?
[2017/09/19, 20:37:23] Luc Hayward: Pressure increase pusges equilibrium to the left
[2017/09/19, 20:38:09] Stuart Mesham: No not that
[2017/09/19, 20:38:33] Luc Hayward: Then I'm confused
[2017/09/19, 20:39:28] Stuart Mesham: Like if from the reaction, the partial pressure of N2O4 decreases by 3 then does the partial pressure of NO2 increase by 6?
[2017/09/19, 20:39:43] Luc Hayward: I think so
[2017/09/19, 20:39:46] Luc Hayward: Does that help
[2017/09/19, 20:40:07] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but using that logic I get the wrong answer :(
[2017/09/19, 20:40:15] Luc Hayward: So it doesn't help
[2017/09/19, 20:40:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I wanted you to say no 🙈
[2017/09/19, 20:41:11] Luc Hayward: 😂so clearly it's not right
[2017/09/19, 20:41:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah unless my equation is wrong 😂
[2017/09/19, 20:41:37] Luc Hayward: Fuck if I know
[2017/09/19, 20:44:52] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/19, 20:45:46] Luc Hayward: Not going to look what it will confuse me
[2017/09/19, 20:46:36] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/09/19, 20:46:58] Luc Hayward: 😂if you thought it was right I would as well
[2017/09/19, 20:47:08] Luc Hayward: But you worked out it's wrong
[2017/09/19, 20:47:27] Stuart Mesham: Ok will just have to find someone who knows tomorrow 😂
[2017/09/19, 20:47:39] Luc Hayward: I'll ask my group
[2017/09/19, 20:47:54] Stuart Mesham: Oh perfect
[2017/09/20, 12:01:08] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>

[2017/09/20, 16:27:51] Luc Hayward: Where you at
[2017/09/20, 16:28:47] Luc Hayward: Where you
[2017/09/20, 16:56:58] Luc Hayward: Fuckall patking
[2017/09/20, 17:05:18] Luc Hayward: I'm by nslt
[2017/09/20, 17:05:36] Stuart Mesham: I'm in M202
[2017/09/20, 17:05:48] Stuart Mesham: Come here, it's better
[2017/09/20, 17:05:54] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/09/20, 19:32:49] Stuart Mesham: Was it just me or did you also find that test kinda kak?
[2017/09/20, 20:01:22] Luc Hayward: It was kak
[2017/09/20, 20:01:28] Luc Hayward: Much harder than before
[2017/09/20, 20:01:32] Luc Hayward: Not too had
[2017/09/20, 20:01:36] Luc Hayward: But harder
[2017/09/20, 20:02:30] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/20, 20:04:23] Luc Hayward: Maybe 5 I was confused with
[2017/09/20, 20:06:23] Stuart Mesham: Oh I think I guessed a bit more than that
[2017/09/20, 20:07:04] Stuart Mesham: All the buffer + dissociation calculations I couldn't get them to work out somehow
[2017/09/20, 20:07:15] Stuart Mesham: It was quite annoying
[2017/09/20, 20:07:32] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/09/21, 17:55:53] Luc Hayward: Describe how I know the concentrastions of the ions in the unknown solutions and *What other method can be used*... I just read it off the graph, is that acceptable and then my alternate method is find a line of best fit and calculate?
[2017/09/21, 19:10:07] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I did line of best fit and then said read off graph for the alternative method
[2017/09/21, 21:02:32] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/21, 21:13:39] Stuart Mesham: 😂😂

[2017/09/22, 12:25:10] Luc Hayward: Else I can't access it's private variables in my child class can I?
[2017/09/22, 12:25:39] Luc Hayward: Fuck I cant
[2017/09/22, 12:25:52] Luc Hayward: What's the point then how do I do it

[2017/09/23, 14:37:36] Luc Hayward: Not a fucking clue I left it blank
[2017/09/23, 17:08:12] Stuart Mesham: 🐺 Wolfram bru 😏👌🏻
[2017/09/23, 17:08:34] Luc Hayward: It doesn't give an exact answer
[2017/09/23, 17:08:46] Stuart Mesham: It does 😂
[2017/09/23, 17:08:54] Luc Hayward: Not for mine
[2017/09/23, 17:09:12] Stuart Mesham: It gave me the fractions to type in
[2017/09/23, 17:09:21] Luc Hayward: Have new long decimals

[2017/09/26, 12:56:28] Stuart Mesham: I'll ask Dan when he gets home but I doubt he'll want to 😂
[2017/09/26, 22:08:42] Luc Hayward: Else Keegan? I dno we don't know anyone who can code I guess we could ask on the vul
[2017/09/26, 23:06:04] Stuart Mesham: Did you see I sent Maria an email
[2017/09/26, 23:06:23] Stuart Mesham: Hopefully she'll find someone 😂

[2017/09/29, 10:16:57] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/09/29, 10:17:04] Luc Hayward: I'm so far behind
[2017/09/29, 10:17:06] Stuart Mesham: And Aslam
[2017/09/29, 10:17:11] Luc Hayward: Exactly
[2017/09/29, 10:17:16] Stuart Mesham: Comp sci?
[2017/09/29, 10:17:21] Luc Hayward: Everything
[2017/09/29, 10:17:53] Stuart Mesham: Same I haven't done much in terms of catching up stuff
[2017/09/29, 10:18:21] Stuart Mesham: Oh well, it's future Stu's problem
[2017/09/29, 10:42:17] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/09/29, 10:42:27] Luc Hayward: I'm fucking locked out of my house and my electric fence is on
[2017/09/29, 11:05:28] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/09/29, 11:05:41] Luc Hayward: Fuck that hurt
[2017/09/29, 11:05:41] Stuart Mesham: How's it going?
[2017/09/29, 11:05:45] Luc Hayward: Tried to jump the fence
[2017/09/29, 11:05:54] Luc Hayward: Got shocked hard
[2017/09/29, 11:05:54] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/09/29, 11:06:05] Stuart Mesham: That's hilarious 😂
[2017/09/29, 11:06:23] Stuart Mesham: Wait are you still outside?
[2017/09/29, 11:12:08] Luc Hayward: Was holding the metal bar that the wires attach to but apparently they aren't insulated
[2017/09/29, 11:18:03] Stuart Mesham: Ouch 😂
[2017/09/29, 11:18:51] Stuart Mesham: Who has they keys?
[2017/09/29, 11:31:00] Luc Hayward: I'm in!
[2017/09/29, 11:31:49] Stuart Mesham: Naas 👌🏻😄
[2017/09/29, 14:52:49] Stuart Mesham: https://icpc.baylor.edu/private/team/337370 This thing says your registration isn't complete?
[2017/09/29, 15:05:42] Luc Hayward: Will double check it maybe I forgot to save
[2017/09/29, 15:06:07] Stuart Mesham: Cool
[2017/09/29, 15:27:37] Luc Hayward: all done
[2017/09/30, 12:16:37] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/30, 12:19:11] Stuart Mesham: Naas 😂👏🏻
[2017/09/30, 12:22:33] Luc Hayward: Got so much fucking work
[2017/09/30, 12:45:44] Stuart Mesham: Same, even though I've been at home for most of the week I just didn't do any work 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/09/30, 12:59:49] Luc Hayward: xD
[2017/09/30, 13:00:18] Luc Hayward: I'm thinking to start a shared set of notes for comp sci for like important things to remember for tests?
[2017/09/30, 13:00:45] Stuart Mesham: Yeah good idea 💡
[2017/09/30, 13:02:02] Luc Hayward: sent it to you
[2017/09/30, 13:02:20] Stuart Mesham: Got it, thanks 👌🏻
[2017/09/30, 13:02:41] Luc Hayward: unless you would prefer a google doc but i think this is better?
[2017/09/30, 13:56:18] Stuart Mesham: Yeah this is better
[2017/09/30, 13:56:37] Luc Hayward: cool cool
[2017/09/30, 13:57:05] Luc Hayward: A lot of my stuff will be screenshots with some extra explanation
[2017/09/30, 13:57:51] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool
[2017/09/30, 13:58:12] Luc Hayward: 😂 I still have three comp sci lectures to catch up
[2017/09/30, 13:59:11] Luc Hayward: "We're open to any rants comments opinions...just don't come toitoi..." A. Safla
[2017/09/30, 13:59:22] Stuart Mesham: I'm not even gonna try catch up comp sci lectures. My excuse is the internet's better on campus so I'll do it there. 😂
[2017/09/30, 13:59:29] Stuart Mesham: 😂😂😂
[2017/09/30, 13:59:45] Stuart Mesham: Edgy 👏🏻😂
[2017/09/30, 13:59:55] Luc Hayward: I read the textbook it was faster nearly
[2017/09/30, 14:00:33] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok
[2017/09/30, 14:00:38] Stuart Mesham: Strategic
[2017/09/30, 14:00:59] Luc Hayward: I wish that drive told you when someone edited a shared file
[2017/09/30, 14:07:54] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/30, 14:08:23] Stuart Mesham: 😂👌🏻
[2017/09/30, 14:08:32] Stuart Mesham: So accurate
[2017/09/30, 14:08:52] Luc Hayward: ok starting abstract classes with aslam now
[2017/09/30, 14:09:03] Luc Hayward: he takes wayyyy too long to say what they are
[2017/09/30, 14:09:35] Stuart Mesham: The next test is only neeext week
[2017/09/30, 14:09:42] Luc Hayward: yep
[2017/09/30, 14:10:07] Stuart Mesham: Pleeeenty of time 😄
[2017/09/30, 14:11:07] Luc Hayward: 3 weeks to the ACM regionals
[2017/09/30, 14:30:55] Stuart Mesham: Now _that's_ not much time 😂
[2017/09/30, 14:31:35] Stuart Mesham: I hope _someone_ shows up below us on the scoreboard otherwise it'll be awkward 😄
[2017/09/30, 14:31:20] Luc Hayward: "Open curly close curly semicolon"
[2017/09/30, 14:33:56] Luc Hayward: xD I'm sure
[2017/09/30, 14:34:36] Luc Hayward: I'm impressed it accepts unicode but I guess it needs to else it would freak out over non-latin characters
[2017/09/30, 14:35:14] Luc Hayward: the ACM thing i mean
[2017/09/30, 14:35:18] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I was also kinda surprised the arrow worked 😄
[2017/09/30, 14:36:53] Luc Hayward: have you caught up maths and shit
[2017/09/30, 15:04:51] Stuart Mesham: No, I'm gonna try do that tonight and tomorrow
[2017/09/30, 15:05:05] Luc Hayward: what you doing n ow
[2017/09/30, 15:05:09] Stuart Mesham: I'll just try do the tutorials
[2017/09/30, 15:05:21] Stuart Mesham: I'm at Tyger's house
[2017/09/30, 15:05:33] Luc Hayward: Oh right he moved home didnt he
[2017/09/30, 15:05:48] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/09/30, 15:06:20] Luc Hayward: right right. Such a ncie day outside here
[2017/09/30, 15:07:00] Stuart Mesham: Yeah can't waste the day on maths 😂
[2017/09/30, 15:10:17] Luc Hayward: exactly
[2017/09/30, 15:34:19] Luc Hayward: <pointy brackets>
[2017/09/30, 15:39:01] Luc Hayward: you should watch the very last block of lexture 29 comp sci its on uml
[2017/09/30, 15:39:11] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/09/30, 15:39:43] Stuart Mesham: Ah thanks
[2017/10/01, 10:10:39] Luc Hayward: did you get chemistry notes form the last lecture for me?
[2017/10/01, 10:16:51] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it was a tut though
[2017/10/01, 10:43:54] Stuart Mesham: Oh I've also got lecture notes for you
[2017/10/01, 11:01:02] Luc Hayward: Thanks. 💛
[2017/10/02, 08:52:29] Luc Hayward: Where you at
[2017/10/02, 08:58:21] Luc Hayward: Stu
[2017/10/03, 09:02:21] Stuart Mesham: There are notes on a chair by the door
[2017/10/03, 09:11:35] Luc Hayward: Kk
[2017/10/03, 09:17:03] Luc Hayward: Comp sci test 2 sign ups open now
[2017/10/03, 09:33:36] Luc Hayward: Here's some pictures

[2017/10/03, 09:33:36] Luc Hayward: South side and commerce labs are open again
[2017/10/03, 09:33:50] Luc Hayward: In Keegan's lecture too. They have a fire extinguisher😂
[2017/10/03, 09:41:23] Stuart Mesham: Oh no 😂
[2017/10/03, 16:55:26] Stuart Mesham: Have you done question 2 of comp sci?
[2017/10/03, 19:04:30] Luc Hayward: Nearly
[2017/10/03, 19:49:32] Stuart Mesham: Tell me when you've done the random number thing, it keeps giving me different numbers to the sample output
[2017/10/03, 20:09:25] Luc Hayward: did you use the correct seed
[2017/10/03, 20:10:22] Stuart Mesham: I don't get the "get on digit and times by 10" bit since the random thing doesn't give me a single digit answer
[2017/10/03, 20:10:44] Stuart Mesham: Also it says the seed needs to be from 1 to 9 but in the example it's 10???
[2017/10/03, 20:18:39] Luc Hayward: ??
[2017/10/03, 20:18:41] Luc Hayward: really?
[2017/10/03, 20:20:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah idk what's cracking with that bit, I don't understand it at all 😂
[2017/10/03, 20:34:53] Luc Hayward: I'll try tomorrow
[2017/10/04, 11:34:01] Stuart Mesham: You still in the NLT?
[2017/10/04, 13:02:22] Stuart Mesham: Soz I went back for tea
[2017/10/04, 13:08:00] Luc Hayward: Chilled
[2017/10/04, 13:08:07] Luc Hayward: See you tomorrow👌🏻
[2017/10/04, 13:27:59] Stuart Mesham: Yeah see you tomorrow
[2017/10/04, 14:10:24] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/04, 14:12:30] Luc Hayward: D looks like it should have the arrow on the rhs but the rest is good
[2017/10/04, 14:18:19] Stuart Mesham: Oh I was a bit confused about that, where do you put the second arrow on the right hand side?
[2017/10/04, 14:18:33] Luc Hayward: There are none on the rhs
[2017/10/04, 14:19:10] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/04, 14:20:47] Stuart Mesham: But the reaction goes both ways
[2017/10/04, 14:24:53] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/10/04, 14:25:29] Luc Hayward: Then yours is correct
[2017/10/04, 14:37:29] Stuart Mesham: I think there might need to be another arrow though, to show that the H separates from the O but I don't know how to show that
[2017/10/04, 14:49:13] Luc Hayward: Tell me when you hit q7
[2017/10/04, 14:49:30] Luc Hayward: Nah leave it till tomorrow
[2017/10/04, 14:49:40] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/04, 14:50:34] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I hit question 7 so now I'm hitting the textbook
[2017/10/04, 14:50:54] Stuart Mesham: Making myself comfy for a long read 😂
[2017/10/04, 14:51:52] Stuart Mesham: And I'm even more clueless for the next page so I'm really in for a textbook trek
[2017/10/04, 14:54:23] Luc Hayward: I think it means pick which H+ is more likely to dissociate
[2017/10/04, 15:01:34] Stuart Mesham: Same, but you have to give an explanation 😕
[2017/10/04, 15:13:33] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/04, 15:36:50] Luc Hayward: And 8
[2017/10/04, 17:01:46] Stuart Mesham: But stronger base means weaker conjugate acid
[2017/10/04, 17:01:56] Stuart Mesham: So I was going to say the opposite
[2017/10/04, 17:02:49] Stuart Mesham: I was gonna say the H bonded to the N is a stronger acid because it has a weaker conjugate base
[2017/10/04, 17:04:04] Stuart Mesham: (For a)
[2017/10/04, 17:05:41] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait nevermind
[2017/10/04, 17:06:18] Stuart Mesham: More electronegative means weaker base so stronger acid so it is the H attached to the O
[2017/10/04, 17:07:26] Stuart Mesham: So I agree for all 3
[2017/10/04, 17:12:55] Luc Hayward: Ok cool
[2017/10/04, 17:13:02] Luc Hayward: And 8 I'm very confused
[2017/10/04, 17:31:08] Stuart Mesham: I think I got question 8
[2017/10/04, 17:31:56] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/04, 17:39:17] Luc Hayward: The only thing we agree on is that A is last
[2017/10/04, 17:39:23] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/04, 17:40:18] Luc Hayward: But
[2017/10/04, 17:40:38] Luc Hayward: I changed my mind
[2017/10/04, 17:40:43] Luc Hayward: You're right
[2017/10/04, 17:40:46] Luc Hayward: We agree now
[2017/10/04, 17:50:08] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/04, 17:56:39] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/04, 17:57:52] Luc Hayward: I read my answer out the notes
[2017/10/04, 17:58:28] Stuart Mesham: Which ones?
[2017/10/04, 17:58:49] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/04, 17:59:54] Luc Hayward: So those say that the the benzene ring has a lower pKa because the delocalised e- can stablise the conjugate base. so converserly the regular cyclohexane must be a stronger base
[2017/10/04, 18:00:44] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/04, 18:21:32] Luc Hayward: flow diagram for chemistyr needed or no?
[2017/10/04, 18:21:58] Luc Hayward: nvm i see it is
[2017/10/05, 12:57:20] Luc Hayward: You on campus?
[2017/10/05, 13:01:04] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/05, 13:01:42] Stuart Mesham: A bird just attacked my sandwich _again_ while I walked back to the NLT
[2017/10/05, 13:04:18] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/10/05, 13:04:27] Luc Hayward: Ok I'll walk down now I think.
[2017/10/05, 13:04:37] Luc Hayward: I'm at comp sci side
[2017/10/05, 13:05:11] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna go see an extra time person in 15 minutes though but it should be short so I'll be back soon afterwards
[2017/10/05, 13:05:37] Stuart Mesham: Then I'll wait in the NLT until a maths tut at 2
[2017/10/05, 13:05:49] Luc Hayward: Oh chilled
[2017/10/05, 13:06:19] Stuart Mesham: Ok see you just now then
[2017/10/05, 13:06:39] Luc Hayward: Nah at you tomorrow🤷🏻‍♂️👌🏻
[2017/10/05, 13:07:26] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok never mind 😂
[2017/10/05, 17:47:54] Luc Hayward: you on?
[2017/10/05, 17:56:13] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/05, 17:56:27] Luc Hayward: Its ok I worked it out xD
[2017/10/05, 17:57:23] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/10/05, 17:58:45] Luc Hayward: But thanks, was going to ask a super basic chem question is all
[2017/10/05, 18:00:17] Luc Hayward: actually
[2017/10/05, 18:00:37] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/05, 18:00:50] Luc Hayward: those are my equilibrium values, does tha kc look ok then?
[2017/10/05, 18:00:58] Luc Hayward: kc is for right
[2017/10/05, 18:01:04] Luc Hayward: sorry ill show it all
[2017/10/05, 18:01:17] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/05, 18:01:39] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/05, 18:01:47] Stuart Mesham: These were mine
[2017/10/05, 18:01:54] Stuart Mesham: My first few
[2017/10/05, 18:02:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it does look right
[2017/10/05, 18:02:34] Luc Hayward: seems ok
[2017/10/05, 18:02:36] Stuart Mesham: But my Kc was jumping around all over the place, so don't trust it 😂
[2017/10/05, 18:02:47] Luc Hayward: just gonna trfust excel xD
[2017/10/05, 18:03:04] Stuart Mesham: Good choice 😄
[2017/10/06, 11:11:24] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/06, 14:02:05] Stuart Mesham: What's this?
[2017/10/06, 14:04:21] Luc Hayward: Nothing I was just using you so I could see it and email them. 😂
[2017/10/06, 14:04:39] Stuart Mesham: Oh 😂
[2017/10/06, 14:56:32] Stuart Mesham: Is it just me or do these UML notes contradict themselves quite a bit?
[2017/10/06, 15:41:38] Luc Hayward: no idea reading it now seems like someone in chat agreess
[2017/10/06, 16:01:31] Luc Hayward: Where?
[2017/10/06, 16:07:53] Luc Hayward: same issue!!!!!!
[2017/10/06, 16:25:57] Stuart Mesham: This is kinda stressful 😂
[2017/10/06, 16:35:27] Luc Hayward: I'm going to finish with one second to spare legit
[2017/10/06, 16:35:56] Luc Hayward: also I'm going with this pages arrows because internet agrees
[2017/10/06, 16:36:05] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/06, 16:36:29] Luc Hayward: that is to say that the diamond is on the side of the containing object. IE a car contains an engine
[2017/10/06, 16:38:05] Stuart Mesham: Crap I did all of mine the wrong way around 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/10/06, 16:38:31] Stuart Mesham: Do we use empty diamonds or filled in ones?
[2017/10/06, 16:39:25] Luc Hayward: i dno that's just what i assume cus the rest of the notes look to be the same
[2017/10/06, 16:40:23] Luc Hayward: open diamond means it can survive alone (ie an engine is an engine even if the car goes away) but a black diamond means they only exist together (if a book dissapeasrs there are no pages, just sheets of paper
[2017/10/06, 16:40:35] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'll change mine and then point to the notes and squeal if they don't accept it
[2017/10/06, 16:41:09] Stuart Mesham: Can a subject survive without a permission? 🤷🏻‍♂
[2017/10/06, 16:41:11] Stuart Mesham: Maybe
[2017/10/06, 16:41:14] Stuart Mesham: Maybe not
[2017/10/06, 16:44:44] Stuart Mesham: I'm just using empty ones for all of mine
[2017/10/06, 16:48:24] Luc Hayward: fuck I'm going to have to go over time
[2017/10/06, 17:01:30] Luc Hayward: missed it entirely
[2017/10/06, 17:04:08] Stuart Mesham: Oh shit
[2017/10/06, 17:05:03] Luc Hayward: do you remember off hand if i have an hour to hand in
[2017/10/06, 17:05:10] Luc Hayward: like before it drops to 20% off
[2017/10/06, 17:05:24] Luc Hayward: or do i have till 5 tomorrow night at 10% off?
[2017/10/06, 17:09:57] Luc Hayward: I can't actually seeeeeeeeeee my fuckign uml assignment still so do we have to include getters setters and constructors? or just constructors and other methods
[2017/10/06, 18:17:39] Stuart Mesham: Whoa what happened?
[2017/10/06, 18:17:49] Stuart Mesham: Are you still going?
[2017/10/06, 18:19:31] Luc Hayward: nah I gave up, finished it now to what im happy with
[2017/10/06, 18:19:48] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok
[2017/10/07, 10:15:43] Luc Hayward: lad where you at
[2017/10/08, 14:31:07] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 14:34:40] Stuart Mesham: Aaaah! 😂
[2017/10/08, 14:36:16] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/10/08, 14:36:54] Stuart Mesham: Negative 😂
[2017/10/08, 14:37:13] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/10/08, 14:37:26] Stuart Mesham: I will be starting my webassign shortly though
[2017/10/08, 14:37:50] Stuart Mesham: Yep that's fairly accurate 😂
[2017/10/08, 14:43:45] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/10/08, 16:02:28] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 16:09:21] Luc Hayward: It's w3 I think
[2017/10/08, 16:09:38] Luc Hayward: You makes them all points that are on a unit circle
[2017/10/08, 16:10:01] Luc Hayward: So like w0 is 1+1i
[2017/10/08, 16:10:12] Stuart Mesham: I keep getting stuck though 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/10/08, 16:11:26] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 16:12:02] Stuart Mesham: If you rationalise the last one using the difference of squares trick you get 0 at the bottom
[2017/10/08, 16:12:38] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait no you get 2
[2017/10/08, 16:12:42] Luc Hayward: Gg
[2017/10/08, 16:12:41] Stuart Mesham: Never mind
[2017/10/08, 16:13:43] Luc Hayward: It's OK
[2017/10/08, 17:00:48] Luc Hayward: struggling to understand how to do the taylor series pls help
[2017/10/08, 17:01:47] Stuart Mesham: Question 6?
[2017/10/08, 17:03:04] Stuart Mesham: I'm actually struggling with that one now but I think I just figured it out
[2017/10/08, 17:03:07] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/10/08, 17:03:16] Luc Hayward: I don't understand why this is wrong
[2017/10/08, 17:03:32] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:03:47] Luc Hayward: So mine is of degree two which means like this right?
[2017/10/08, 17:04:35] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/08, 17:04:51] Stuart Mesham: But only 2 terms I think
[2017/10/08, 17:05:23] Luc Hayward: did you get your one right?
[2017/10/08, 17:05:28] Luc Hayward: surely three terms?
[2017/10/08, 17:06:28] Luc Hayward: can i see yours?
[2017/10/08, 17:06:09] Stuart Mesham: No my derivatives started getting unwieldy because mine says degree 4
[2017/10/08, 17:06:40] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:06:44] Stuart Mesham: So I got to degree 3 and gave up and started looking for an alternative strategy
[2017/10/08, 17:07:04] Stuart Mesham: I don't have an answer
[2017/10/08, 17:07:49] Luc Hayward: fuck
[2017/10/08, 17:07:47] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait it's degree 2
[2017/10/08, 17:08:10] Stuart Mesham: I read it like 5 times and I read "4" every time 🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/10/08, 17:08:34] Stuart Mesham: Hold on, I'll try get an answer now
[2017/10/08, 17:08:56] Luc Hayward: send me yours i want to try too
[2017/10/08, 17:09:41] Luc Hayward: Then I can understand where I'm goign wrong
[2017/10/08, 17:10:54] Stuart Mesham: Wait P3(x) means 3rd degree
[2017/10/08, 17:12:07] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:12:37] Luc Hayward: But mine says otherwsie what the hell
[2017/10/08, 17:12:47] Luc Hayward: is that the textbook
[2017/10/08, 17:13:31] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:13:44] Stuart Mesham: No it's this random site http://www.math.smith.edu/~rhaas/m114-00/chp4taylor.pdf
[2017/10/08, 17:15:06] Luc Hayward: asked jono
[2017/10/08, 17:15:19] Luc Hayward: I'll try do yours tell me if you get it right
[2017/10/08, 17:15:35] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/10/08, 17:18:11] Luc Hayward: wait
[2017/10/08, 17:18:14] Luc Hayward: my notes are wrong
[2017/10/08, 17:18:15] Luc Hayward: fuck
[2017/10/08, 17:19:13] Luc Hayward: thats why
[2017/10/08, 17:19:19] Luc Hayward: it should look like this
[2017/10/08, 17:19:41] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:23:01] Luc Hayward: please try that
[2017/10/08, 17:24:31] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:24:52] Luc Hayward: no thats wrong
[2017/10/08, 17:25:07] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/10/08, 17:25:08] Luc Hayward: wait
[2017/10/08, 17:25:08] Stuart Mesham: Why?
[2017/10/08, 17:25:23] Luc Hayward: what even is that xD
[2017/10/08, 17:25:30] Luc Hayward: ok first one is right
[2017/10/08, 17:25:44] Luc Hayward: but you need to evaluate it at x=1
[2017/10/08, 17:26:16] Luc Hayward: sso ln9
[2017/10/08, 17:26:29] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:26:35] Stuart Mesham: No you don't need to evaluate
[2017/10/08, 17:26:39] Luc Hayward: then the next term is right but it should be x-1 not 1-x
[2017/10/08, 17:26:41] Luc Hayward: you do
[2017/10/08, 17:26:45] Luc Hayward: thats the whole point
[2017/10/08, 17:26:51] Stuart Mesham: It's the taylor polynomial about 1 not evaluated at 1
[2017/10/08, 17:26:58] Luc Hayward: do you want to just hang outs
[2017/10/08, 17:27:19] Stuart Mesham: So normally for maclauren things you do them about 0
[2017/10/08, 17:27:35] Stuart Mesham: But for Taylor series they can be about another number
[2017/10/08, 17:27:42] Luc Hayward: go hangouts
[2017/10/08, 17:27:48] Stuart Mesham: Meaning they are a good approximation near that number
[2017/10/08, 17:27:54] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/10/08, 17:28:15] Stuart Mesham: Hold on I just want to check my answer with wolfram quick
[2017/10/08, 17:30:11] Luc Hayward: wolfram doesnt like natural logs
[2017/10/08, 17:33:33] Luc Hayward: I fucking give up
[2017/10/08, 17:34:04] Stuart Mesham: Wait a minute I did it the wrong way around
[2017/10/08, 17:34:03] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:35:03] Stuart Mesham: 6 is definitely a mistake because on the internet it also says p3x means 3rd degree
[2017/10/08, 17:36:03] Luc Hayward: ok so have you checked? is mine right or does it need to go further
[2017/10/08, 17:36:05] Luc Hayward: hangouts?
[2017/10/08, 17:36:30] Stuart Mesham: Wait I'm still redoing mine
[2017/10/08, 17:36:54] Luc Hayward: k
[2017/10/08, 17:39:56] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:40:13] Luc Hayward: ok so they still only wanted degree 2
[2017/10/08, 17:40:20] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/08, 17:40:43] Luc Hayward: got mine as well then
[2017/10/08, 17:40:45] Stuart Mesham: Use this formula where a = 1
[2017/10/08, 17:40:47] Luc Hayward: now to the next one
[2017/10/08, 17:41:27] Stuart Mesham: Wow
[2017/10/08, 17:41:35] Stuart Mesham: The next one is quite something
[2017/10/08, 17:44:03] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:44:49] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:45:38] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:45:58] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/10/08, 17:46:05] Luc Hayward: and the expansion of x is just x
[2017/10/08, 17:46:04] Stuart Mesham: I don't think we're supposed to do that
[2017/10/08, 17:46:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/08, 17:47:25] Luc Hayward: oh you think we just go for it with the normal one?
[2017/10/08, 17:48:17] Luc Hayward: oh because its mclaurin
[2017/10/08, 17:47:50] Stuart Mesham: I think so
[2017/10/08, 17:49:07] Luc Hayward: so e^x is always just going to be .... but it doesnt work out
[2017/10/08, 17:48:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah so you can just substitute different things for x in
[2017/10/08, 17:49:39] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:51:12] Stuart Mesham: No don't do that
[2017/10/08, 17:51:29] Luc Hayward: but is that wrong? they should come out the same
[2017/10/08, 17:51:47] Stuart Mesham: I we're supposed to be able to avoid taking derivatives by using the premade formulas
[2017/10/08, 17:52:37] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/10/08, 17:52:40] Luc Hayward: sooooo
[2017/10/08, 17:52:53] Stuart Mesham: The middle column looks fine but I don't understand the right column
[2017/10/08, 17:53:20] Stuart Mesham: Hold on I'm just gonna try stuff for a while
[2017/10/08, 17:53:42] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 17:54:08] Luc Hayward: the right column is the middle column evaluated for x=a=0
[2017/10/08, 17:56:02] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok then it looks right
[2017/10/08, 17:56:33] Luc Hayward: but its not, the green circle is what you're saying aND THE RIGHT COLUMN IS MEANT TO be the same
[2017/10/08, 17:56:35] Luc Hayward: excuse caps
[2017/10/08, 18:00:57] Stuart Mesham: Ok here come a new much more ratchet theory
[2017/10/08, 18:02:48] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>

[2017/10/08, 18:04:08] Stuart Mesham: Oh so does the first way actually work?
[2017/10/08, 18:05:38] Stuart Mesham: Oh fantastic
[2017/10/08, 18:06:32] Luc Hayward: so it appears that it looks like so
[2017/10/08, 18:11:01] Luc Hayward: tell me when you knpow
[2017/10/08, 18:11:12] Stuart Mesham: Sure

[2017/10/08, 18:19:20] Stuart Mesham: I also tried that 😂
[2017/10/08, 18:19:35] Luc Hayward: Fuck me
[2017/10/08, 18:19:46] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm watching some youtube videos now, hoping to get some insight
[2017/10/08, 18:20:13] Luc Hayward: I dont understand what you wrote there
[2017/10/08, 18:20:54] Stuart Mesham: I'm watching youtube videos about maclauren polynomials

[2017/10/08, 18:27:14] Stuart Mesham: Awesome
[2017/10/08, 18:28:02] Luc Hayward: i think
[2017/10/08, 18:28:07] Luc Hayward: let me try submitting first

[2017/10/08, 18:32:55] Luc Hayward: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK i got it wrong twice
[2017/10/08, 18:33:22] Stuart Mesham: Soz
[2017/10/08, 18:33:45] Stuart Mesham: No point in hangouts, I've got 0 information for you
[2017/10/08, 18:35:48] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna ask Nic
[2017/10/08, 18:35:52] Stuart Mesham: I give up too
[2017/10/08, 18:35:53] Luc Hayward: please god
[2017/10/08, 19:06:51] Luc Hayward: mate
[2017/10/08, 19:06:55] Luc Hayward: you done 7?
[2017/10/08, 19:07:42] Stuart Mesham: No I tried to work out 6 but I got a completely different answer to wolfram so I just typed in the wolfram one and gave up 🙇🏻
[2017/10/08, 19:07:52] Luc Hayward: and 7?
[2017/10/08, 19:07:56] Stuart Mesham: Just use the pre-made e^x formula
[2017/10/08, 19:11:37] Luc Hayward: tried that
[2017/10/08, 19:12:43] Luc Hayward: but that says.... thats says that

[2017/10/08, 19:15:30] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 19:16:07] Stuart Mesham: I think there may just be an adding mistake or something in yours
[2017/10/08, 19:16:31] Luc Hayward: nic told me i was being a nob
[2017/10/08, 19:16:55] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/10/08, 19:24:56] Luc Hayward: hmm didnt nail it
[2017/10/08, 19:25:17] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/08, 19:26:38] Stuart Mesham: This one's so hard to check because the numbers are so ugly
[2017/10/08, 19:26:42] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/10/08, 19:26:44] Luc Hayward: wait
[2017/10/08, 19:27:07] Luc Hayward: no that seems..., ill ask nic>
[2017/10/08, 19:27:26] Stuart Mesham: Are you confident that the e to the y formula at the top is right?
[2017/10/08, 19:31:29] Luc Hayward: I got mine, did you?
[2017/10/08, 19:31:42] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I did
[2017/10/08, 19:31:47] Stuart Mesham: All is well
[2017/10/09, 09:16:55] Luc Hayward: Should I come to chemistry if I arrive by 20 past
[2017/10/09, 09:17:23] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/09, 09:17:57] Stuart Mesham: I only got here at 12 past and she seemed fine with it 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/10/09, 09:18:32] Luc Hayward: But will I know what's happening or will I just have to watch the video again
[2017/10/09, 09:19:05] Stuart Mesham: I dunno. I don't really know what's going on
[2017/10/09, 09:19:37] Stuart Mesham: Just come though
[2017/10/09, 09:19:49] Stuart Mesham: You'll understand the part that she's on now
[2017/10/09, 09:21:09] Luc Hayward: Nah I'm so late
[2017/10/09, 09:21:17] Luc Hayward: Missed half the lecture already
[2017/10/09, 09:21:27] Luc Hayward: Will just catch her up online I'll see you at maths
[2017/10/09, 09:21:36] Stuart Mesham: Ok see you
[2017/10/09, 16:04:49] Stuart Mesham: You at home?
[2017/10/09, 16:22:21] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/10/09, 16:22:24] Luc Hayward: Why?
[2017/10/09, 17:16:31] Luc Hayward: You where you at
[2017/10/09, 17:16:54] Stuart Mesham: I'm in the library
[2017/10/09, 17:25:13] Luc Hayward: Fuck me I have no headset tell me when you go to the hall. Waiting in car
[2017/10/09, 17:25:36] Stuart Mesham: As in no earphones?
[2017/10/09, 17:26:45] Luc Hayward: Jersey *******
[2017/10/09, 17:27:02] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok
[2017/10/09, 17:27:22] Stuart Mesham: I'll go at 17:45
[2017/10/09, 17:45:45] Stuart Mesham: I'm going now
[2017/10/09, 17:45:54] Luc Hayward: I'll meet you there
[2017/10/09, 17:45:56] Stuart Mesham: My time is here
[2017/10/09, 17:45:57] Stuart Mesham: My time is now
[2017/10/09, 17:46:07] Stuart Mesham: Ok see you in a bit
[2017/10/09, 17:46:20] Luc Hayward: Kk
[2017/10/09, 17:48:14] Luc Hayward: Have you gone in
[2017/10/09, 18:45:05] Luc Hayward: ay
[2017/10/09, 18:53:12] Luc Hayward: Let's discuss
[2017/10/09, 18:53:15] Luc Hayward: Easy test
[2017/10/09, 18:53:18] Luc Hayward: Too long
[2017/10/09, 18:53:21] Luc Hayward: Couldn't finish
[2017/10/09, 18:53:28] Luc Hayward: Everything was pretty chilled
[2017/10/09, 18:53:50] Luc Hayward: Black diamonds for medical aid and pension thing both 1-1
[2017/10/09, 18:56:40] Luc Hayward: What is the output of this code (the one with A instanceOf B) I said B is an instance of c (the second if statement) buy I actually wanted to write that it can't work because the blank constructor of the child class was called but there was no blank constructor in the parent class so surely it gives a runtime error?
[2017/10/09, 19:37:34] Stuart Mesham: Oh I didn't notice the runtime error
[2017/10/09, 19:37:47] Luc Hayward: Ok good that means it was unintended
[2017/10/09, 19:38:02] Stuart Mesham: But I said it was an instance of both but I wasn't sure if it could be an instance of an interface
[2017/10/09, 19:38:12] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2017/10/09, 19:38:15] Luc Hayward: Don't think so
[2017/10/09, 19:39:09] Stuart Mesham: I left the UML for last but I ended up with only 2 minutes to do it so I just drew squares with the class names and then the white arrow for the inherited ones and a straight line to the medical aid thing
[2017/10/09, 19:40:09] Luc Hayward: It is right for both fuck
[2017/10/09, 19:40:25] Luc Hayward: Going to argue that it's unfair because the code can't run
[2017/10/09, 19:42:13] Stuart Mesham: Just argue quietly so they don't change mine 😂
[2017/10/09, 19:42:30] Stuart Mesham: I hope nobody posts it on the Vula chat
[2017/10/09, 19:45:08] Luc Hayward: No but I never wrote that it doesn't run
[2017/10/09, 19:45:24] Luc Hayward: I just said that only if statement two worked so I'm just totally wrong 😂
[2017/10/09, 19:45:36] Luc Hayward: I want to argue that we all get the marks
[2017/10/09, 19:46:11] Stuart Mesham: Oh no 😂
[2017/10/09, 19:46:26] Stuart Mesham: This is risky for me
[2017/10/09, 19:47:24] Stuart Mesham: Oh unless they just give us the marks yeah should've read that 😂
[2017/10/09, 20:10:04] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/10/10, 12:33:28] Stuart Mesham: Yaaay we finished early! More tea time!
[2017/10/10, 13:02:54] Luc Hayward: xD
[2017/10/10, 20:51:40] Stuart Mesham: Are you sure the voting website isn't a phishing website? 😂
[2017/10/10, 20:51:47] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/10/10, 20:52:03] Stuart Mesham: How sure?
[2017/10/10, 20:52:12] Luc Hayward: Of the uct website
[2017/10/10, 20:52:15] Luc Hayward: Off
[2017/10/10, 20:52:24] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/10/11, 09:44:33] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/11, 13:41:11] Stuart Mesham: You still here?
[2017/10/11, 13:48:22] Stuart Mesham: On second thoughts, are you going to the maths revision lecture now?
[2017/10/11, 13:48:30] Luc Hayward: nein
[2017/10/11, 13:49:35] Stuart Mesham: Me neither actually
[2017/10/11, 13:49:59] Stuart Mesham: It's a Q&A type thing so it probably won't be great
[2017/10/11, 13:50:10] Luc Hayward: recorded
[2017/10/11, 13:50:21] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/11, 13:59:49] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/11, 14:06:20] Luc Hayward: I dont think so
[2017/10/11, 14:06:40] Luc Hayward: that has to do with  whether the nucleophile is more basic
[2017/10/11, 14:32:40] Luc Hayward: I think A is the better base
[2017/10/11, 14:34:48] Stuart Mesham: Oh is that due to more delocalisation of the electrons on the O?
[2017/10/11, 14:35:24] Luc Hayward: How do we do the next one
[2017/10/11, 14:35:38] Luc Hayward: I'm not sure, it just seems like the rightanswer
[2017/10/11, 14:35:50] Stuart Mesham: Ok 😂
[2017/10/11, 14:36:02] Stuart Mesham: Wow the next one I have to idea
[2017/10/11, 14:36:19] Stuart Mesham: *no
[2017/10/11, 14:39:55] Luc Hayward: hangouts?
[2017/10/11, 14:40:46] Stuart Mesham: Gonna take a tea brake first
[2017/10/11, 14:41:46] Luc Hayward: kk
[2017/10/11, 14:48:42] Luc Hayward: I think i understand
[2017/10/11, 14:48:54] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/10/11, 14:59:25] Stuart Mesham: I'm still drinking tea but I'm looking at my tutorial _and_ drinking tea now
[2017/10/11, 14:59:44] Luc Hayward: im making lunch noq
[2017/10/11, 14:59:50] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/10/11, 15:00:06] Stuart Mesham: Video call quickly?
[2017/10/11, 15:00:46] Stuart Mesham: Because I think I know how to do a and b
[2017/10/11, 15:08:17] Luc Hayward: bacxk
[2017/10/11, 15:09:19] Luc Hayward: I know how to do them all
[2017/10/11, 15:10:05] Stuart Mesham: Hold on I gotta go to the toilet but are the first 2 Markovnikov's rule?
[2017/10/11, 15:10:13] Luc Hayward: yes
[2017/10/11, 15:22:06] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/11, 15:25:47] Luc Hayward: yes
[2017/10/11, 15:32:10] Luc Hayward: finished
[2017/10/11, 15:32:45] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/10/11, 15:32:46] Luc Hayward: wait
[2017/10/11, 15:32:48] Luc Hayward: help
[2017/10/11, 15:37:41] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/11, 15:39:32] Stuart Mesham: Hm
[2017/10/11, 15:39:40] Stuart Mesham: Interesting
[2017/10/11, 15:39:56] Stuart Mesham: At first I thought they were graphics people
[2017/10/11, 15:43:03] Stuart Mesham: Did you look in the textbook or the notes for the rest of the tutorial?
[2017/10/11, 15:43:20] Luc Hayward: both do you want me to ecplain
[2017/10/11, 15:43:59] Stuart Mesham: I'm actually still not sure what to do for the rest of page 5 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/10/11, 15:47:38] Luc Hayward: you wnat hangouts/?
[2017/10/11, 15:47:45] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/11, 15:47:56] Stuart Mesham: WhatsApp call maybe?
[2017/10/11, 15:48:37] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/11, 15:48:52] Luc Hayward: hangouts is easier
[2017/10/11, 15:48:55] Luc Hayward: or skype
[2017/10/11, 15:49:00] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/10/11, 18:29:04] Luc Hayward: good god
[2017/10/11, 18:29:06] Luc Hayward: holy balls
[2017/10/11, 18:29:15] Luc Hayward: I just spent so much time i hope this works
[2017/10/11, 18:29:31] Stuart Mesham: On what?
[2017/10/11, 18:29:34] Luc Hayward: Firstly, 604 lines of xml
[2017/10/11, 18:29:44] Stuart Mesham: Oh no 😂
[2017/10/11, 18:29:50] Luc Hayward: That's how long the keymap for intelliJ is for just one keymap
[2017/10/11, 18:30:05] Luc Hayward: I decided I cannot possibly learn two different sets of shortcuts
[2017/10/11, 18:30:17] Luc Hayward: and I like the mac ones because I'm already sort of used to them
[2017/10/11, 18:30:42] Luc Hayward: But windows hasn't got a meta key or any way to bind one (meta key is the actual underlying name for the command key on mac)
[2017/10/11, 18:31:05] Stuart Mesham: What on earth were you doing? 😂
[2017/10/11, 18:31:43] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/11, 18:31:44] Luc Hayward: So I'm going to bind one of my macro keys
[2017/10/11, 18:32:36] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/11, 18:32:37] Luc Hayward: To the tilde/grave key (looks like a squigly line in the top left of a keyboard, you might not have one. It's used for nothing by intelliJ I checked
[2017/10/11, 18:32:49] Luc Hayward: and use that instead its genius
[2017/10/11, 18:33:45] Stuart Mesham: 😂😂😂
[2017/10/11, 18:34:19] Stuart Mesham: Wow you worked hard to figure this out I can tell 😂😂
[2017/10/11, 18:34:31] Stuart Mesham: Did it work? 😂
[2017/10/11, 18:35:36] Luc Hayward: fuck
[2017/10/11, 18:35:42] Luc Hayward: https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/platform/platform-resources/src/keymaps/Mac%20OS%20X%2010.5%2B.xml
[2017/10/11, 18:35:49] Luc Hayward: here that's the keymap I'm using on my mac
[2017/10/11, 18:36:17] Stuart Mesham: I'm guessing that's a no 😂
[2017/10/11, 18:36:44] Luc Hayward: no what I wanted to do was just change all the meta modifiers to be tilde
[2017/10/11, 18:37:00] Luc Hayward: but tilde isnt a fucking modifier key so it probably won't work 😭😭
[2017/10/11, 18:37:15] Luc Hayward: oooooh wait
[2017/10/11, 18:37:16] Luc Hayward: maybe
[2017/10/11, 18:37:48] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/10/11, 18:37:50] Luc Hayward: new plan
[2017/10/11, 18:37:56] Luc Hayward: just rebind all the meta keys to control
[2017/10/11, 18:38:10] Luc Hayward: anywhere I say meta I mean command/the apple key
[2017/10/11, 18:42:58] Luc Hayward: moment of truth
[2017/10/11, 18:43:10] Luc Hayward: I either fixed this or I broke everything and will have to undo it all
[2017/10/11, 18:44:11] Luc Hayward: your keymap that you are able to edit is only supposed to contain the changes(They call it the delta) between the original template you started with and what you have now. So mine used to be about 10 lines total and now its 600 because I just copied the entire original keymap and changed metal for control
[2017/10/11, 18:49:16] Stuart Mesham: Aaaaaannndddddd did it work?
[2017/10/11, 18:55:55] Luc Hayward: uhmmm
[2017/10/11, 18:56:16] Luc Hayward: gaREIKUgbakdfshinjgkol/;vrh/dbln'b/ghjl uvv/lujofrdszgfilhvrhsi/ol;afvh;in/ol.asN?H>:LFgvb/jn dzsfg/bljgB"HaERphibgftibph/larwebilhkn;gvblIKHN: sdflb/gl/badrjblrgfbljarfblghv/ibgohlúsfdghib?ÄS
[2017/10/11, 18:56:20] Luc Hayward: it worked i think
[2017/10/11, 18:57:39] Luc Hayward: it worked but some stuff is broken
[2017/10/11, 19:00:19] Luc Hayward: In principle it works
[2017/10/11, 19:00:36] Luc Hayward: but there is too much that overlaps now where it shouldnt
[2017/10/11, 19:00:55] Luc Hayward: Decided I will just change my most used things
[2017/10/11, 19:01:14] Stuart Mesham: But that's accepting defeat 😂
[2017/10/11, 19:01:41] Luc Hayward: It is
[2017/10/11, 19:01:53] Luc Hayward: but there isnt a good way to do it otherwise I dont think
[2017/10/12, 13:12:48] Luc Hayward: Is chemistry in pairs
[2017/10/12, 13:12:54] Luc Hayward: Or do I need my own prac book
[2017/10/12, 13:13:20] Stuart Mesham: Soz you need your own
[2017/10/12, 13:13:53] Luc Hayward: Feck
[2017/10/12, 13:13:56] Luc Hayward: You got yours ?
[2017/10/12, 13:14:06] Luc Hayward: Else I'll print this weeks prac
[2017/10/12, 13:34:13] Stuart Mesham: No sorry
[2017/10/12, 13:34:23] Luc Hayward: Kk
[2017/10/12, 15:50:39] Stuart Mesham: Oh damn
[2017/10/12, 15:50:50] Stuart Mesham: I didn't pass the bio prac test
[2017/10/12, 16:12:12] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/12, 16:12:17] Luc Hayward: Look ok?
[2017/10/12, 16:13:29] Stuart Mesham: Yeah looks the same as mine
[2017/10/12, 16:13:53] Stuart Mesham: Same results
[2017/10/12, 16:13:59] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/10/12, 16:20:54] Luc Hayward: How's comp sci going
[2017/10/12, 16:42:58] Stuart Mesham: Almost done 👍🏻
[2017/10/12, 16:43:46] Luc Hayward: total time since I left you in nlt?
[2017/10/12, 16:44:20] Stuart Mesham: No I went to bio and then to maths tut
[2017/10/12, 16:44:32] Luc Hayward: so total?
[2017/10/12, 16:44:52] Stuart Mesham: No I've got to the end and handed
[2017/10/12, 16:45:02] Stuart Mesham: I just haven't fixed the errors yet
[2017/10/12, 16:45:21] Luc Hayward: sooooo total estimated time since where you were when i left?
[2017/10/12, 16:45:21] Stuart Mesham: Oh total +- 45 min
[2017/10/12, 16:45:26] Luc Hayward: thanks
[2017/10/12, 18:00:42] Luc Hayward: total?
[2017/10/12, 18:30:57] Stuart Mesham: What?
[2017/10/12, 18:31:12] Luc Hayward: How long did it end up taking xD
[2017/10/12, 18:31:49] Stuart Mesham: It was a just a 2 minute fix 😂
[2017/10/12, 18:32:15] Stuart Mesham: You'll definitely be able to do it tomorrow stop stressing 😂
[2017/10/13, 07:14:35] Luc Hayward: Going to fourth periods chemistry and 5 th period comp sci
[2017/10/13, 07:14:50] Luc Hayward: Have somewhere to be at 8 and might not get back by 9
[2017/10/13, 07:19:37] Stuart Mesham: Ok see you in comp sci
[2017/10/13, 07:40:17] Luc Hayward: I'll be in math?
[2017/10/13, 08:48:06] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/10/13, 08:56:36] Luc Hayward: I'll make it
[2017/10/13, 08:56:42] Luc Hayward: Chemistry now
[2017/10/13, 08:56:56] Luc Hayward: Will be a little late but I'll make it
[2017/10/13, 08:58:20] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/10/13, 08:58:21] Stuart Mesham: See you now
[2017/10/13, 08:59:11] Luc Hayward: Will be 10 min later
[2017/10/13, 14:38:27] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/13, 14:39:02] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/10/13, 14:39:13] Stuart Mesham: Did you hand that in?
[2017/10/13, 14:40:06] Luc Hayward: Yeah first thing that worked, what was I meant to do
[2017/10/13, 14:42:34] Stuart Mesham: I dunno I just did 1000 random tests
[2017/10/13, 14:56:04] Luc Hayward: Wait how?
[2017/10/13, 14:57:26] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/13, 14:57:41] Stuart Mesham: I did one for all 0s, one for all 100s and then this one
[2017/10/13, 14:58:51] Stuart Mesham: But didn't Nic say he just did one other test case and he got 100? 😂
[2017/10/13, 15:00:23] Luc Hayward: dno
[2017/10/14, 09:53:37] Luc Hayward: Running late but I'll be there
[2017/10/14, 10:06:28] Stuart Mesham: You made an account for this right?
[2017/10/14, 10:17:21] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/10/14, 10:17:27] Luc Hayward: Do you need the sin in!
[2017/10/14, 10:17:30] Luc Hayward: Sign in
[2017/10/14, 10:17:34] Luc Hayward: I'm 2 min away
[2017/10/15, 12:17:08] Luc Hayward: bro
[2017/10/15, 12:17:10] Luc Hayward: webassign
[2017/10/15, 12:25:57] Stuart Mesham: Shit
[2017/10/15, 12:25:58] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/15, 12:26:07] Luc Hayward: help
[2017/10/15, 12:26:21] Stuart Mesham: Oh I thought that was a reminder 😂
[2017/10/15, 12:26:51] Luc Hayward: It's both
[2017/10/15, 12:27:04] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna make an attempt now and then I'll come back and ask you for help too
[2017/10/15, 12:27:20] Luc Hayward: just open it you'll get stuck on question 1
[2017/10/15, 12:28:53] Stuart Mesham: Shit
[2017/10/15, 12:29:00] Stuart Mesham: Yes I did
[2017/10/15, 12:29:00] Luc Hayward: rihgt
[2017/10/15, 12:29:25] Stuart Mesham: Lecture notes before Nic though 😂
[2017/10/15, 12:29:42] Luc Hayward: Í wrote it at a sin(A+B) = cossin+sincos
[2017/10/15, 12:30:03] Stuart Mesham: That was smart
[2017/10/15, 12:30:06] Stuart Mesham: I'll be back
[2017/10/15, 12:30:41] Luc Hayward: don't leave me
[2017/10/15, 12:32:13] Stuart Mesham: Found it!
[2017/10/15, 12:32:18] Stuart Mesham: Lecture notes 7
[2017/10/15, 12:32:19] Luc Hayward: what how
[2017/10/15, 12:32:24] Stuart Mesham: Right at the top
[2017/10/15, 12:32:42] Stuart Mesham: Mashudu's notes
[2017/10/15, 12:33:15] Luc Hayward: hmm?
[2017/10/15, 12:33:26] Luc Hayward: That was fast?
[2017/10/15, 12:33:40] Stuart Mesham: Thanks 😂
[2017/10/15, 12:33:47] Luc Hayward: how
[2017/10/15, 12:34:22] Stuart Mesham: I started from the last lecture on complex numbers (8) and went backwards 😂
[2017/10/15, 12:34:29] Luc Hayward: Ah I got it, I opened on to the wrong section and went back instead of forwards
[2017/10/15, 12:35:02] Stuart Mesham: It's the one with all the es
[2017/10/15, 12:35:16] Luc Hayward: I hvae it
[2017/10/15, 12:35:33] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 12:36:01] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I think we use this
[2017/10/15, 12:41:54] Luc Hayward: Still stuck
[2017/10/15, 12:43:31] Stuart Mesham: I have a feeling that we're ment to get a general formula
[2017/10/15, 12:43:38] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait no
[2017/10/15, 12:44:11] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 12:46:20] Stuart Mesham: I'm looking at lecture 6 now
[2017/10/15, 12:50:08] Luc Hayward: hmnmm
[2017/10/15, 12:50:20] Stuart Mesham: We can maybe use eulers formula to work out e^(6i) in terms of sin(6) and cos(6)?
[2017/10/15, 12:51:43] Luc Hayward: how will that help
[2017/10/15, 12:52:42] Stuart Mesham: Then i won't be in the exponent any more
[2017/10/15, 12:52:48] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 12:56:52] Luc Hayward: doesnt help
[2017/10/15, 12:58:40] Luc Hayward: still lost
[2017/10/15, 12:57:36] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I have no idea what to do now
[2017/10/15, 12:57:42] Stuart Mesham: Maybe just Google
[2017/10/15, 12:58:50] Luc Hayward: tyried
[2017/10/15, 12:58:59] Stuart Mesham: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1113702/express-sinz-and-cosz-in-rectangular-form
[2017/10/15, 13:00:00] Stuart Mesham: These have sinh and cosh in their answers though
[2017/10/15, 13:00:12] Luc Hayward: can't use those
[2017/10/15, 13:00:13] Stuart Mesham: But they're technically the answer
[2017/10/15, 13:00:24] Luc Hayward: it accepts them but its wrong
[2017/10/15, 13:00:21] Stuart Mesham: Why not?
[2017/10/15, 13:00:52] Luc Hayward: like it accepts them but it isn't the way we are supposed to do the,
[2017/10/15, 13:00:48] Stuart Mesham: It accepts them??
[2017/10/15, 13:01:20] Luc Hayward: I've used sinh before in an answer for webassign
[2017/10/15, 13:01:44] Stuart Mesham: Are you sure we're not supposed to do it like that though?
[2017/10/15, 13:03:21] Luc Hayward: we don't do hyperbolic trig functions they've never been taught
[2017/10/15, 13:04:07] Stuart Mesham: I swear either Jono or Mashudu wrote one of them on the board once and then said "but you don't need to know this"
[2017/10/15, 13:04:52] Luc Hayward: and so it isnt the intended solution
[2017/10/15, 13:05:17] Stuart Mesham: I have no idea how else to it
[2017/10/15, 13:06:30] Luc Hayward: ask on the groupo?
[2017/10/15, 13:08:04] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 13:08:50] Stuart Mesham: The first step is Euler's formula
[2017/10/15, 13:09:21] Stuart Mesham: Then cos always = 0 and sin always = 1 for those values
[2017/10/15, 13:09:52] Stuart Mesham: Having lunch now, will be back a bit later
[2017/10/15, 14:35:13] Luc Hayward: couldnt do it
[2017/10/15, 15:09:10] Stuart Mesham: Just gonna wait for Nic now 🙈
[2017/10/15, 15:10:23] Luc Hayward: how much hace you done?
[2017/10/15, 15:10:33] Luc Hayward: I got 2 wrong and Dont know why I foloowed what the notes tell us
[2017/10/15, 15:10:54] Stuart Mesham: Still none
[2017/10/15, 15:25:28] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 15:28:17] Luc Hayward: hmm?
[2017/10/15, 15:28:27] Luc Hayward: oh ok so he made those graphs up
[2017/10/15, 15:28:36] Luc Hayward: basically they repesent the rhd of each eqn
[2017/10/15, 15:28:53] Stuart Mesham: How? 😂
[2017/10/15, 15:28:54] Luc Hayward: rhs
[2017/10/15, 15:29:13] Luc Hayward: so -2 + sqrt5 is positive real and 0i right?
[2017/10/15, 15:29:22] Luc Hayward: sqrt5 is slightly more thn 2
[2017/10/15, 15:29:28] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/10/15, 15:29:40] Stuart Mesham: Oooohhh
[2017/10/15, 15:29:49] Luc Hayward: so when the sqrt is positive its all positive yeah?
[2017/10/15, 15:29:57] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/15, 15:29:59] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/15, 15:30:13] Luc Hayward: I got 2 of them now (1 and 3) but 2 I couldn't make work, got a similar answer to what I got in the notes, just didnt acccept it
[2017/10/15, 15:30:22] Luc Hayward: Think you're doing 2 now?
[2017/10/15, 15:30:28] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/15, 15:30:36] Stuart Mesham: I haven't done 1 though
[2017/10/15, 15:30:48] Luc Hayward: Please can you send me your question so I can try it as well and then see if I get the answer the same as you?
[2017/10/15, 15:30:56] Luc Hayward: Cus i thought I knew what to do but clearly not
[2017/10/15, 15:31:12] Stuart Mesham: sin(z) = 3i
[2017/10/15, 15:31:31] Luc Hayward: and the requirements?
[2017/10/15, 15:32:19] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 15:35:39] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 15:36:54] Stuart Mesham: no I got 3 +- sqrt 10
[2017/10/15, 15:37:15] Luc Hayward: ah mistake higher up
[2017/10/15, 15:38:19] Luc Hayward: agreed
[2017/10/15, 15:37:17] Stuart Mesham: But I used the calculator to do the quadratic
[2017/10/15, 15:38:17] Stuart Mesham: Did you also have (e^iz)^2 + 6(e^iz) - 1 = 0?
[2017/10/15, 15:38:43] Luc Hayward: yes
[2017/10/15, 15:38:57] Luc Hayward: and we use the -sqrt10
[2017/10/15, 15:39:40] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/15, 15:40:50] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 15:41:06] Stuart Mesham: is x 0 or 2pi?
[2017/10/15, 15:41:25] Luc Hayward: which line?
[2017/10/15, 15:41:36] Stuart Mesham: Never mind
[2017/10/15, 15:41:44] Luc Hayward: ok tell me if you agree?
[2017/10/15, 15:44:41] Stuart Mesham: Agreed
[2017/10/15, 15:45:29] Stuart Mesham: Ugh it was wrong
[2017/10/15, 15:47:05] Luc Hayward: We got the same though?
[2017/10/15, 15:47:07] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/10/15, 15:47:10] Luc Hayward: I have one we can try
[2017/10/15, 15:47:36] Luc Hayward: Lets try sin(z) = 2i
[2017/10/15, 15:47:40] Luc Hayward: because we know the answer to it
[2017/10/15, 15:47:50] Luc Hayward: So try do that without consulting the notes and see if we get the right answer
[2017/10/15, 15:48:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/15, 15:52:31] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 15:53:42] Luc Hayward: which is what the notes say
[2017/10/15, 15:53:45] Luc Hayward: so what gives
[2017/10/15, 15:53:47] Stuart Mesham: I only did the negative e^iz one but I got the wrong answer
[2017/10/15, 15:54:03] Stuart Mesham: I have -2 inside my brackets where it should be 2
[2017/10/15, 15:54:34] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/10/15, 15:54:59] Luc Hayward: you can say -2-sqrt5 or 2+sqrt5 because we take the absolute value
[2017/10/15, 15:55:04] Stuart Mesham: You've also got it
[2017/10/15, 15:55:14] Stuart Mesham: Look at your one on the left
[2017/10/15, 15:55:32] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/10/15, 15:55:39] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/10/15, 15:55:58] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 15:56:28] Stuart Mesham: I didn't do the absolute value maybe that's why my web assign one is wrong
[2017/10/15, 15:56:56] Stuart Mesham: Yaaay it's right now
[2017/10/15, 15:58:02] Luc Hayward: hmm maybe i made a mistake in mine similar to you
[2017/10/15, 15:58:05] Luc Hayward: oh well
[2017/10/15, 15:58:07] Luc Hayward: onwards
[2017/10/15, 16:02:58] Stuart Mesham: Dammit, I got it wrong
[2017/10/15, 16:03:17] Luc Hayward: which one
[2017/10/15, 16:03:25] Stuart Mesham: 3
[2017/10/15, 16:03:37] Luc Hayward: show me yours
[2017/10/15, 16:04:02] Luc Hayward: should probably be ln(double the red numbers) =i(-pi/3+2pi)
[2017/10/15, 16:04:04] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 16:04:05] Luc Hayward: - not =
[2017/10/15, 16:04:29] Luc Hayward: ln 6
[2017/10/15, 16:04:32] Luc Hayward: the rest is correct
[2017/10/15, 16:06:14] Luc Hayward: better?
[2017/10/15, 16:05:25] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah
[2017/10/15, 16:06:09] Stuart Mesham: You were right
[2017/10/15, 16:06:57] Luc Hayward: yeah you just forgot to do ln
[2017/10/15, 16:07:12] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/15, 16:08:30] Luc Hayward: ók brb
[2017/10/15, 16:15:20] Luc Hayward: bck
[2017/10/15, 16:18:39] Luc Hayward: finish 4?
[2017/10/15, 16:19:19] Stuart Mesham: Tea break ☕😄
[2017/10/15, 16:23:08] Luc Hayward: Right Right
[2017/10/15, 16:23:17] Luc Hayward: I'm onto 5 so I cn help again
[2017/10/15, 17:17:13] Luc Hayward: Hey man, whats the quadratic factor if -2+3i is a zero?
[2017/10/15, 17:27:40] Luc Hayward: nvm I'm a chop
[2017/10/15, 17:51:24] Stuart Mesham: I'm back
[2017/10/15, 17:51:33] Stuart Mesham: Wow that was quite a tea break
[2017/10/15, 17:52:42] Luc Hayward: just tea??
[2017/10/15, 18:00:24] Stuart Mesham: Well it was a family tea 😂
[2017/10/15, 18:00:56] Luc Hayward: ahhh
[2017/10/15, 18:06:15] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 18:15:53] Stuart Mesham: Oh no no nooooooo it's a nightmare 😂
[2017/10/15, 19:24:31] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 20:10:30] Luc Hayward: How did you do that
[2017/10/15, 20:46:28] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 20:48:57] Luc Hayward: This looks like more than one question
[2017/10/15, 20:49:39] Stuart Mesham: No it's actually just one. Just ignore the 2 lines at the top, they don't come first
[2017/10/15, 20:50:56] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/15, 20:51:25] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/10/15, 20:51:30] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah sorry that's another question
[2017/10/15, 20:54:03] Luc Hayward: Ok cool
[2017/10/16, 08:39:57] Luc Hayward: I'm going to be so fucking late
[2017/10/16, 08:46:17] Luc Hayward: What's the rain like?
[2017/10/16, 09:03:47] Stuart Mesham: Not bad
[2017/10/16, 09:04:16] Luc Hayward: Ok I'm late as donkey crack
[2017/10/16, 09:04:26] Luc Hayward: Still on the highway
[2017/10/16, 09:04:48] Luc Hayward: Maybe another 10/15 min I might just luss this Chem lecture and catch the recording
[2017/10/16, 09:08:32] Luc Hayward: Hope far in is she
[2017/10/16, 09:08:34] Luc Hayward: How
[2017/10/16, 09:14:32] Luc Hayward: Will I understand if I come now?
[2017/10/16, 09:40:23] Stuart Mesham: Where are you now?
[2017/10/16, 09:40:40] Luc Hayward: In chemistry
[2017/10/16, 09:40:50] Luc Hayward: Yore sitting next to a girl in black
[2017/10/16, 09:41:03] Luc Hayward: At desk 4
[2017/10/16, 09:42:06] Luc Hayward: Please grab me a set of notes off her desk when you leave ?
[2017/10/16, 09:45:03] Stuart Mesham: I think you've already got those?
[2017/10/16, 09:45:14] Luc Hayward: I can't find them
[2017/10/16, 09:45:31] Luc Hayward: If she has on her desk
[2017/10/16, 15:14:25] Luc Hayward: It makes me so happy that charles uses intelliJ
[2017/10/16, 15:53:52] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/10/16, 15:54:10] Stuart Mesham: Did he use it in the lectures?
[2017/10/16, 15:54:45] Luc Hayward: yep
[2017/10/16, 15:55:21] Stuart Mesham: What a lad 😂
[2017/10/16, 17:49:23] Luc Hayward: Lad
[2017/10/18, 09:09:48] Luc Hayward: Thinking chemistry, maths, comp sci (SIPP), then engineering library till 2, go to a tut and then comp sci prac? I know you have bio after csc
[2017/10/18, 09:10:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but I'm also going to go to a bio tut after bio
[2017/10/18, 09:11:04] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/10/18, 09:11:08] Stuart Mesham: But I'll still come to comp sci prac
[2017/10/18, 09:11:15] Luc Hayward: Naturally
[2017/10/18, 09:11:21] Luc Hayward: And maths tut or nah?
[2017/10/18, 09:11:42] Stuart Mesham: Maybe chem tut is more urgent 😂
[2017/10/18, 09:12:16] Luc Hayward: It's fast
[2017/10/18, 09:12:31] Luc Hayward: Faster than the last one so far
[2017/10/18, 09:44:59] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/18, 12:52:21] Stuart Mesham: Engineering library?
[2017/10/18, 13:16:34] Luc Hayward: Nah
[2017/10/18, 13:16:52] Luc Hayward: Will meet you in maths tut later
[2017/10/18, 13:36:02] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/10/18, 13:36:13] Stuart Mesham: How do you do page 2 of the chem tut?
[2017/10/18, 14:04:48] Luc Hayward: Uhm halfway through first set of notes from last week
[2017/10/18, 14:05:30] Stuart Mesham: The ones that say SW B5 at the front?
[2017/10/18, 14:05:42] Luc Hayward: Think so
[2017/10/18, 14:05:58] Luc Hayward: It's before aldehydes and ketones
[2017/10/18, 14:06:05] Stuart Mesham: What's the heading of the section?
[2017/10/18, 14:07:35] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/18, 14:08:11] Luc Hayward: That one is for page 4/5onwards
[2017/10/18, 14:08:17] Luc Hayward: Use the one before for the tart
[2017/10/18, 14:08:19] Luc Hayward: Start
[2017/10/18, 14:09:07] Luc Hayward: What tut are we going to
[2017/10/18, 14:09:11] Luc Hayward: Or are you lussing
[2017/10/18, 14:09:38] Stuart Mesham: No I'm gonna do the chem tut now or I don't think I'll be able to finish it by tomorrow 😂
[2017/10/18, 14:11:31] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/18, 14:15:27] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/10/18, 14:17:16] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/18, 14:22:13] Luc Hayward: Where are you?
[2017/10/18, 14:29:38] Luc Hayward: Come to m202
[2017/10/18, 14:30:09] Stuart Mesham: The engineering library
[2017/10/18, 14:30:33] Stuart Mesham: Isn't it a bit crowded?
[2017/10/18, 14:31:23] Luc Hayward: Oh ok
[2017/10/18, 14:32:21] Stuart Mesham: Let's do the tut upstairs in the big library
[2017/10/18, 14:32:45] Luc Hayward: I'm doing it in here and writing up maths notes
[2017/10/18, 14:33:51] Stuart Mesham: You _cannot_ do both of those at the same time 😂
[2017/10/18, 14:34:44] Luc Hayward: Depends who is next to me
[2017/10/18, 14:35:39] Stuart Mesham: No you have to choose one
[2017/10/18, 14:36:33] Luc Hayward: No… I write maths when the tutor is behind me and chemistry otherwise
[2017/10/18, 14:37:59] Stuart Mesham: Ok sorry I need to just write chemistry 😂
[2017/10/18, 14:38:32] Luc Hayward: yeah all good
[2017/10/18, 14:38:37] Luc Hayward: will meet prior to comp sci
[2017/10/18, 14:40:37] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/18, 14:46:00] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/18, 14:46:56] Luc Hayward: last one is OH- on the left not just OH neutral
[2017/10/18, 14:47:32] Stuart Mesham: On the left one and not on the right one?
[2017/10/18, 14:47:46] Luc Hayward: yrah
[2017/10/18, 14:47:53] Stuart Mesham: Why?
[2017/10/18, 14:47:59] Luc Hayward: actually not OH
[2017/10/18, 14:48:03] Luc Hayward: just O-
[2017/10/18, 14:48:10] Luc Hayward: replace OH with O- on the left
[2017/10/18, 14:48:28] Stuart Mesham: Isn't it supposed to be the same as with H+ and water?
[2017/10/18, 14:48:43] Luc Hayward: No because now its OH- now H+
[2017/10/18, 14:48:58] Stuart Mesham: Because in both of them one H is donated and one H is removed
[2017/10/18, 14:49:13] Stuart Mesham: Just in the second one the H2O donated the H
[2017/10/18, 14:49:18] Luc Hayward: It's in the notes as O- though in textbook
[2017/10/18, 14:49:20] Stuart Mesham: And the OH removes one
[2017/10/18, 14:49:34] Stuart Mesham: Where is this in the notes?
[2017/10/18, 14:50:39] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/18, 14:51:48] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/10/18, 14:51:59] Stuart Mesham: Nvm I was very wrong
[2017/10/18, 14:52:57] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/10/18, 15:00:50] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/18, 15:01:13] Luc Hayward: thats not right...
[2017/10/18, 15:01:26] Stuart Mesham: What is it meant to be?
[2017/10/18, 15:01:48] Luc Hayward: are you sure its meant to have that NH4Cl?
[2017/10/18, 15:01:57] Luc Hayward: I just had NH3
[2017/10/18, 15:02:08] Luc Hayward: plus the Carbon chain
[2017/10/18, 15:02:19] Luc Hayward: Figured the HCL would form on its own
[2017/10/18, 15:02:26] Stuart Mesham: The notes say NH4Cl
[2017/10/18, 15:02:27] Luc Hayward: Is it meant to form a salt with it?
[2017/10/18, 15:02:29] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/10/18, 15:02:30] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/10/18, 15:03:14] Stuart Mesham: But the example in the notes looks quite different at the start so I'm not sure
[2017/10/18, 15:04:19] Stuart Mesham: Wait a minute the Cl came out of nowhere
[2017/10/18, 15:04:36] Stuart Mesham: I don't think there's meant to be a Cl on the right
[2017/10/18, 15:06:16] Stuart Mesham: I think the one on the right is meant to have NH4+ at the bottom
[2017/10/18, 15:21:51] Luc Hayward: hmm
[2017/10/18, 15:22:22] Luc Hayward: sticking with NH3
[2017/10/18, 15:25:26] Luc Hayward: meet me in m202? or message me when you're arriving by comp sco
[2017/10/18, 15:28:55] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/18, 15:47:28] Luc Hayward: You coming to CSC?
[2017/10/18, 15:47:57] Stuart Mesham: Yeah on my way
[2017/10/18, 15:48:07] Stuart Mesham: Meet you in m202?
[2017/10/18, 15:48:35] Luc Hayward: yeah we can go from here
[2017/10/18, 16:34:20] Luc Hayward: Pretty easy
[2017/10/18, 16:34:33] Luc Hayward: Have you gone home?
[2017/10/18, 16:35:33] Stuart Mesham: Not just yet
[2017/10/18, 16:36:51] Luc Hayward: Last prac Kinda?
[2017/10/18, 16:37:06] Luc Hayward: Not hard just weirdly put yogether
[2017/10/18, 16:52:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it was weird but still quite chilled
[2017/10/18, 16:54:45] Luc Hayward: 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2017/10/18, 16:55:49] Stuart Mesham: 🙆🏻‍♂
[2017/10/18, 18:03:07] Luc Hayward: almost done
[2017/10/18, 19:15:06] Stuart Mesham: Doing mine now
[2017/10/18, 20:24:14] Luc Hayward: I'm done
[2017/10/18, 20:24:33] Luc Hayward: Doing prac now
[2017/10/18, 20:26:46] Stuart Mesham: Cool beans
[2017/10/18, 20:26:56] Stuart Mesham: I am not done
[2017/10/18, 20:26:58] Luc Hayward: its annoying
[2017/10/18, 20:27:05] Luc Hayward: You can yell for help I think I did it right
[2017/10/18, 20:27:15] Stuart Mesham: I know, the prac is annoying
[2017/10/18, 20:27:19] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/18, 20:58:29] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/18, 20:58:35] Luc Hayward: Can you explain Q2 to me?
[2017/10/18, 20:58:53] Luc Hayward: Identitfy the alcohol and carboxylic acid which combine
[2017/10/18, 20:58:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah let me get it
[2017/10/18, 20:58:58] Luc Hayward: did we do it correctly?
[2017/10/18, 20:59:23] Luc Hayward: Thats a normal metal hydride addition reaction
[2017/10/18, 20:59:29] Luc Hayward: Same as the previopus page
[2017/10/18, 20:59:45] Stuart Mesham: Oh I remember now, it was a trick. You don't hand in anything at all at the prac.
[2017/10/18, 21:00:08] Stuart Mesham: So it's not for marks
[2017/10/18, 21:00:20] Stuart Mesham: Not the pre-prac questions and not the flow diagram
[2017/10/18, 21:00:23] Luc Hayward: really/....?
[2017/10/18, 21:00:29] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/18, 21:00:30] Luc Hayward: Whats the point
[2017/10/18, 21:00:50] Stuart Mesham: Idk, they just assume you don't realise, I guess
[2017/10/18, 21:01:03] Stuart Mesham: It worked on me 🤷🏻‍♂
[2017/10/18, 21:01:07] Luc Hayward: So do i need to do it?
[2017/10/18, 21:01:31] Luc Hayward: Or do I just make it look sorta ok
[2017/10/18, 21:01:57] Stuart Mesham: Depends on your demonstrator but mine didn't even look my stuff
[2017/10/18, 21:02:04] Luc Hayward: Mine always looks
[2017/10/18, 21:03:14] Stuart Mesham: Yeah do that
[2017/10/18, 21:03:25] Luc Hayward: kk
[2017/10/18, 21:07:24] Stuart Mesham: Sorry for being dumb but how is it the same as the previous page?
[2017/10/18, 21:08:08] Luc Hayward: Oh I'm so sorry it isnt at all
[2017/10/18, 21:08:13] Luc Hayward: I thought you were further ahead
[2017/10/18, 21:08:18] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/10/18, 21:09:02] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/18, 21:09:44] Stuart Mesham: Is that these notes?
[2017/10/18, 21:10:01] Luc Hayward: yeah about halfway in nearly
[2017/10/18, 21:11:07] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/18, 21:38:57] Luc Hayward: flow diagram ro nah?
[2017/10/18, 21:39:14] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/18, 21:39:36] Stuart Mesham: If your dem checks then just make a really bad one
[2017/10/18, 21:39:39] Luc Hayward: Works for me
[2017/10/18, 21:39:42] Stuart Mesham: Just so it's there
[2017/10/18, 21:39:46] Luc Hayward: Why is that first one secondary
[2017/10/18, 21:40:15] Stuart Mesham: The C that the OH is bonded to is bonded to 2 other Cs
[2017/10/18, 21:40:21] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/10/18, 22:15:24] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/19, 06:34:16] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/10/19, 09:01:24] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/19, 09:01:40] Stuart Mesham: Pulling the comp sci team together 👌🏻😄
[2017/10/19, 09:17:07] Luc Hayward: 😂I'm fetching a sword
[2017/10/19, 09:18:44] Stuart Mesham: What's the sword for? 😂
[2017/10/19, 09:18:53] Luc Hayward: Need it for a party
[2017/10/19, 09:20:10] Stuart Mesham: Awesome
[2017/10/19, 09:20:53] Luc Hayward: Have to get there like 8:30
[2017/10/19, 12:27:26] Luc Hayward: If only

[2017/10/19, 13:30:38] Stuart Mesham: I asked for "the usual" at the sandwich place and they knew
[2017/10/19, 13:39:23] Luc Hayward: Nice
[2017/10/19, 19:32:33] Luc Hayward: Ay comp sci
[2017/10/19, 20:16:13] Stuart Mesham: Your tests also not working?
[2017/10/19, 20:16:29] Stuart Mesham: /getting accepted in the automarkr
[2017/10/19, 20:20:49] Stuart Mesham: Nvm it accepted it now
[2017/10/19, 20:42:45] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/10/19, 20:42:49] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/10/19, 20:42:55] Luc Hayward: How did you do 2?
[2017/10/19, 20:42:59] Luc Hayward: The question two
[2017/10/19, 20:49:37] Stuart Mesham: I imported java.util.Stack 😏
[2017/10/19, 20:49:52] Luc Hayward: You did it with a stack too?
[2017/10/19, 20:49:58] Luc Hayward: Definitely want with the effort
[2017/10/19, 20:50:36] Stuart Mesham: It's *so* much easier than making your own?
[2017/10/19, 20:50:55] Luc Hayward: Mine was a streaming pile if code shit
[2017/10/19, 20:52:04] Stuart Mesham: Mine was also messy but it wasn't that complicated
[2017/10/19, 20:52:58] Luc Hayward: But it was hideous
[2017/10/19, 20:53:06] Luc Hayward: Kept hitting edge cases
[2017/10/19, 20:53:07] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/10/19, 20:53:12] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/10/19, 20:53:33] Luc Hayward: Probably. Because I wrote everything and then realised you had to account for internally mismatched brackets not just left over ones
[2017/10/19, 20:53:42] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/10/19, 20:56:32] Luc Hayward: Please forward me the email or a picture with the times for Saturday
[2017/10/19, 20:57:30] Stuart Mesham: Done!
[2017/10/19, 20:57:36] Luc Hayward: Thanks
[2017/10/19, 20:57:42] Luc Hayward: Think I deleted mine
[2017/10/19, 20:58:11] Stuart Mesham: Oh my goodness it starts at 9 😵
[2017/10/19, 20:58:20] Luc Hayward: Arrive 8:30
[2017/10/19, 20:58:25] Stuart Mesham: Rof
[2017/10/19, 21:00:42] Luc Hayward: Oh well
[2017/10/19, 21:00:46] Luc Hayward: How was testing?
[2017/10/19, 21:00:59] Stuart Mesham: Quite chilled
[2017/10/19, 21:01:24] Luc Hayward: Anything awkward in the English or the automaker that I should know?
[2017/10/19, 21:01:58] Stuart Mesham: Not really
[2017/10/19, 21:02:34] Stuart Mesham: The problem with mine was just that I didn't assert list.size in the trim method test 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/10/19, 21:02:55] Luc Hayward: The description of the 4 tests was a bit weird
[2017/10/19, 21:03:02] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/10/19, 21:03:10] Luc Hayward: Is it just those 4 ?
[2017/10/19, 21:07:35] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/19, 21:07:41] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/10/20, 07:19:51] Luc Hayward: Someone(two people) made your app  and someone was taking about it on Kfm today

[2017/10/20, 07:33:21] Stuart Mesham: Ah damn I took too long 😂
[2017/10/20, 07:33:23] Luc Hayward: Nah the wave is just cool
[2017/10/20, 07:33:39] Stuart Mesham: Stupid EndFrame 😄
[2017/10/20, 07:33:46] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/10/20, 07:33:48] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/10/20, 07:33:52] Luc Hayward: They're Kinda shitty
[2017/10/20, 07:33:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah the wave is quite cool
[2017/10/20, 07:34:09] Stuart Mesham: Oh did you look it up?
[2017/10/20, 07:34:18] Luc Hayward: Yeah downloaded them both
[2017/10/20, 07:34:27] Luc Hayward: They're blatant clones of each other
[2017/10/20, 07:34:36] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/10/20, 07:35:12] Stuart Mesham: It's ok then Swift Lifts' _quality_ will shine through 👌🏻😄
[2017/10/20, 07:35:35] Stuart Mesham: Even though that's what Pied Piper said
[2017/10/20, 16:20:44] Luc Hayward: Question 3 is bullshit
[2017/10/20, 16:43:00] Stuart Mesham: What?
[2017/10/20, 16:43:23] Stuart Mesham: Test list.size()
[2017/10/20, 16:43:34] Luc Hayward: I know
[2017/10/20, 16:43:56] Luc Hayward: I meant it's the stupidest most easy thing
[2017/10/20, 16:44:02] Luc Hayward: the whole section on testing
[2017/10/20, 16:43:58] Stuart Mesham: And test every single element of the list
[2017/10/20, 16:44:07] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah
[2017/10/20, 19:11:56] Luc Hayward: LOLOL Junit Q&A is just a link to stack overflow
[2017/10/20, 22:22:55] Stuart Mesham: Oh haha
[2017/10/21, 08:20:52] Stuart Mesham: I'm here

[2017/10/21, 08:40:34] Stuart Mesham: Lol you drive here barefoot
[2017/10/21, 08:43:32] Luc Hayward: Which lab
[2017/10/21, 08:43:40] Stuart Mesham: Senior
[2017/10/21, 08:43:46] Stuart Mesham: There are signs though
[2017/10/21, 08:44:11] Luc Hayward: No socks either
[2017/10/21, 08:44:18] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/10/21, 08:44:24] Luc Hayward: Icpc or normal senior?
[2017/10/21, 08:44:34] Stuart Mesham: I think normal
[2017/10/21, 08:44:44] Stuart Mesham: There are nice signs though
[2017/10/21, 08:44:51] Stuart Mesham: Look for the signs

[2017/10/22, 13:52:21] Stuart Mesham: Nnnooooooo
[2017/10/22, 13:56:51] Luc Hayward: we fguuuucked
[2017/10/22, 13:56:55] Luc Hayward: webassign?
[2017/10/22, 13:57:21] Stuart Mesham: Already started
[2017/10/22, 13:57:54] Luc Hayward: ay
[2017/10/22, 13:57:57] Luc Hayward: im starting
[2017/10/22, 13:58:47] Stuart Mesham: Good good
[2017/10/22, 17:59:24] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/22, 18:00:21] Stuart Mesham: It is indeed a giant hole of despair
[2017/10/22, 18:00:53] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/22, 18:00:56] Luc Hayward: Still going
[2017/10/22, 18:01:44] Stuart Mesham: Yeah keep at it
[2017/10/22, 18:02:34] Stuart Mesham: Though type each integral into an integral calculator before you work them out because I often wasted a huge amount of time going in the wrong direction trying to integrate stuff 😂
[2017/10/22, 18:02:44] Luc Hayward: oh ok
[2017/10/22, 18:02:46] Luc Hayward: I got it
[2017/10/22, 18:02:49] Luc Hayward: I think
[2017/10/22, 18:02:55] Luc Hayward: checking it against wolfram alpha
[2017/10/22, 18:03:01] Luc Hayward: there version is prettier than mine
[2017/10/22, 18:03:22] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/10/22, 18:03:35] Luc Hayward: And now I'm out of paper and scrpa paper to write on...
[2017/10/22, 18:04:07] Stuart Mesham: This webassign took like 5 hours to do
[2017/10/22, 18:04:14] Luc Hayward: agreement
[2017/10/22, 18:04:18] Stuart Mesham: What a mare
[2017/10/22, 18:04:42] Luc Hayward: I'm writing on the back of tut tests now for stats
[2017/10/22, 18:13:53] Luc Hayward: we dont have second order worked examples
[2017/10/22, 18:22:56] Stuart Mesham: No we do it's the e^rx quadratic thing
[2017/10/22, 18:23:27] Luc Hayward: He never actually showed us how to go about solving for a specific solution, had to khan academy
[2017/10/22, 18:23:55] Stuart Mesham: No he did! It's in lecture 5 I think
[2017/10/22, 18:26:00] Luc Hayward: oh weird
[2017/10/22, 18:46:00] Luc Hayward: Ye almost done but can't make 2 work
[2017/10/22, 18:46:17] Luc Hayward: well one I failed on because i forgot to put the - in but the very last one doesnt seem to work nicely for me
[2017/10/22, 18:49:35] Stuart Mesham: The one with repeated r values?
[2017/10/22, 18:49:48] Luc Hayward: yes
[2017/10/22, 18:49:58] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/22, 18:52:44] Stuart Mesham: What were your r values?
[2017/10/22, 18:52:57] Stuart Mesham: Oh -6
[2017/10/22, 18:53:01] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/10/22, 18:53:17] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/22, 18:54:26] Stuart Mesham: The y0 = 3 = A + Bx line is wrong
[2017/10/22, 18:54:51] Stuart Mesham: X is meant to be 0 so B should disappear
[2017/10/22, 18:55:00] Luc Hayward: it should say 3=A right?
[2017/10/22, 18:55:10] Luc Hayward: thanks didnt notice that
[2017/10/22, 18:55:10] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/22, 18:55:34] Luc Hayward: doesnt help
[2017/10/22, 18:55:38] Luc Hayward: makes it worse
[2017/10/22, 18:56:07] Stuart Mesham: Why?
[2017/10/22, 18:56:37] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/22, 18:56:47] Luc Hayward: How do I make use of the second condition
[2017/10/22, 18:57:27] Stuart Mesham: Did you remember to use the product rule when differentiating the term with B?
[2017/10/22, 18:57:37] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/10/22, 18:57:47] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/10/22, 18:57:58] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/22, 18:58:03] Luc Hayward: checked it online too
[2017/10/22, 18:58:19] Stuart Mesham: xe^x needs to become 2 terms
[2017/10/22, 18:58:41] Stuart Mesham: Noooo
[2017/10/22, 18:58:41] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/22, 18:58:49] Luc Hayward: It does, I just simplified
[2017/10/22, 18:59:14] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/10/22, 18:59:16] Luc Hayward: wait
[2017/10/22, 18:59:27] Stuart Mesham: Try differentiate Ae^x + Bxe^x you should get 1 A term and 2 B terms
[2017/10/22, 18:59:31] Luc Hayward: It doesnt simplify if the A and B are there
[2017/10/22, 18:59:44] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/22, 19:01:27] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/22, 19:02:23] Stuart Mesham: Too many xs in the second last term
[2017/10/22, 19:02:53] Luc Hayward: surely it doesnt matter
[2017/10/22, 19:03:01] Luc Hayward: also really?
[2017/10/22, 19:03:24] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/10/22, 19:03:27] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/10/22, 19:03:30] Luc Hayward: one too many
[2017/10/22, 19:03:37] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/22, 19:03:38] Luc Hayward: doesnt affect the answer i think
[2017/10/22, 19:03:56] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I don't think it does
[2017/10/22, 19:04:02] Luc Hayward: got it
[2017/10/22, 19:04:06] Luc Hayward: see you tomorrow
[2017/10/22, 19:04:09] Luc Hayward: thanks man
[2017/10/22, 19:04:16] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2017/10/23, 17:18:18] Stuart Mesham: Just checking, there are no chem pracs this week are there?
[2017/10/23, 18:15:00] Luc Hayward: yeah no pracs

[2017/10/24, 14:59:04] Luc Hayward: protest walking to bremner to deliver demands
[2017/10/24, 15:00:56] Luc Hayward: Which are idiotic, some of them arent even possible to be fulfilled like having uct release governments fees report

[2017/10/24, 19:38:41] Luc Hayward: Fuck I hate swing
[2017/10/24, 19:43:13] Stuart Mesham: I'm about to join the club
[2017/10/24, 19:43:19] Stuart Mesham: Quick question
[2017/10/24, 19:43:26] Luc Hayward: are you going to do it manually or with wysiwyg
[2017/10/24, 19:43:37] Stuart Mesham: Is the chemistry building P. D. Hahn?
[2017/10/24, 19:43:42] Luc Hayward: yes
[2017/10/24, 19:44:01] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna try do it manually to ready myself for the test
[2017/10/24, 19:46:01] Luc Hayward: same but its a whore
[2017/10/24, 19:46:15] Luc Hayward: I cant get things to stay where I want them to
[2017/10/24, 19:46:31] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/10/24, 19:46:36] Stuart Mesham: Oh dear
[2017/10/24, 19:47:05] Luc Hayward: Like I want them to look like the picture
[2017/10/24, 19:47:07] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/24, 19:47:18] Luc Hayward: But I can't get a border or a margin to work
[2017/10/24, 19:47:21] Stuart Mesham: I'd just go with the flow and let the buttons be wherever they want to be
[2017/10/24, 19:47:31] Stuart Mesham: Oh no they give us a diagram
[2017/10/24, 19:47:42] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/24, 19:48:06] Stuart Mesham: What a mare
[2017/10/24, 19:49:49] Luc Hayward: Sit with me tomorrow and do it afer maths?
[2017/10/24, 19:50:21] Stuart Mesham: No I'm doing chemistry tomorrow sorry 😄
[2017/10/24, 19:50:26] Luc Hayward: ??
[2017/10/24, 19:50:29] Luc Hayward: Oh the tut?
[2017/10/24, 19:50:35] Stuart Mesham: Yeab
[2017/10/24, 19:50:36] Luc Hayward: yeah well finish tut then do comp sci ?
[2017/10/24, 19:50:50] Luc Hayward: Tut takes me 2 hours to do alone, together we can easy do it in less
[2017/10/24, 19:50:56] Stuart Mesham: Yeah will probably be going home by then though
[2017/10/24, 19:51:22] Stuart Mesham: I dunno we can try
[2017/10/24, 19:53:03] Luc Hayward: You not coming to maths tut?
[2017/10/24, 19:54:31] Luc Hayward: Tell me how you go with designing the gui
[2017/10/24, 20:51:48] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/24, 20:52:06] Stuart Mesham: I did everything the same as his lecture slides
[2017/10/24, 20:57:03] Luc Hayward: Because it's swing
[2017/10/24, 20:57:10] Luc Hayward: So the button just fills the frame
[2017/10/24, 20:57:40] Luc Hayward: You should jump straight into extending jframe
[2017/10/24, 20:57:48] Luc Hayward: So class test extends jframe
[2017/10/24, 20:58:10] Luc Hayward: And then you call the constructor in its own main method
[2017/10/24, 20:58:27] Stuart Mesham: Right
[2017/10/24, 20:59:13] Stuart Mesham: I think I'm just gonna go to sleep now, will see you tomorrow
[2017/10/24, 20:59:21] Luc Hayward: Same cheers
[2017/10/24, 20:59:37] Stuart Mesham: Do you think I need to watch the chem lecture video before tomorrow's lecture?
[2017/10/24, 21:03:46] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/10/24, 21:04:02] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/24, 21:04:10] Luc Hayward: But scan the notes we didn't get too far
[2017/10/24, 21:04:10] Stuart Mesham: That's what I wanted to hear 😂
[2017/10/24, 21:04:14] Luc Hayward: Uhm
[2017/10/24, 21:04:45] Luc Hayward: We did entropy calculations
[2017/10/24, 21:05:04] Luc Hayward: Basically up until the page on how to tell whether a reaction is spontaneous
[2017/10/24, 21:05:07] Luc Hayward: I think
[2017/10/24, 21:05:30] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/24, 21:09:08] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/24, 21:10:20] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/10/24, 21:10:40] Stuart Mesham: Swing is never nice
[2017/10/24, 21:11:10] Luc Hayward: Screenshotting you saying that and agreeing with me finally xD
[2017/10/24, 21:11:15] Stuart Mesham: I'm a changed man 😂
[2017/10/24, 21:11:40] Stuart Mesham: I was blind but now I see
[2017/10/24, 21:11:46] Luc Hayward: Good
[2017/10/24, 21:11:52] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/10/24, 21:15:09] Luc Hayward: Unfortunately it's not the go to in the real world
[2017/10/25, 07:25:50] Luc Hayward: Going to jono today I think
[2017/10/25, 08:23:35] Stuart Mesham: Think I'm actually just going to come in a bit later because I need to watch a few lecture videos anyway ( and it's raining )
[2017/10/25, 08:43:06] Luc Hayward: Class is oh so empty and so nice compared to mashudu
[2017/10/25, 08:54:00] Luc Hayward: Come to lecture
[2017/10/25, 08:54:16] Luc Hayward: You're just falling more behind
[2017/10/25, 09:04:02] Stuart Mesham: No I'm staying the same distance behind 😂
[2017/10/25, 09:04:10] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/10/25, 09:04:15] Stuart Mesham: Are you going to Mashudu's maths?
[2017/10/25, 09:04:47] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/25, 09:04:50] Luc Hayward: Nah
[2017/10/25, 09:04:55] Luc Hayward: Jono is way better
[2017/10/25, 09:05:13] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/25, 09:05:28] Luc Hayward: Arrived late and I went to him after the lecture and he was like "I saw you came in late is there anything you missed?" And then explained and knew his shit
[2017/10/25, 09:05:47] Stuart Mesham: So we've been going to the wrong lecture? 😂
[2017/10/25, 09:05:59] Stuart Mesham: Oh wow
[2017/10/25, 09:10:35] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/10/25, 09:10:41] Luc Hayward: He goes really fast though
[2017/10/25, 09:44:45] Luc Hayward: The face of a man on the edge of flipping his shit 

https://twitter.com/varsitynews/status/922830845781651456
[2017/10/25, 09:47:59] Stuart Mesham: Yoh he looks so over this 😂
[2017/10/25, 09:48:55] Stuart Mesham: That's the "I've been doing this for 3 years too long" face
[2017/10/25, 09:50:58] Stuart Mesham: When the guy said "comrades" I cringed 😂
[2017/10/25, 10:01:26] Luc Hayward: You on campus later?
[2017/10/25, 10:01:38] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/25, 10:01:43] Luc Hayward: Time?
[2017/10/25, 10:02:19] Stuart Mesham: I'll be there at 12 for bio so maybe see you at 1?
[2017/10/25, 10:33:29] Luc Hayward: you ok?
[2017/10/25, 10:33:40] Luc Hayward: they're protesting, saw they were outside copano like an houra go
[2017/10/25, 10:34:10] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I the fire alarm was going off continuously
[2017/10/25, 10:34:18] Luc Hayward: Fucking hell
[2017/10/25, 10:34:30] Stuart Mesham: How's campus looking?
[2017/10/25, 10:36:44] Luc Hayward: heading to south stop
[2017/10/25, 10:37:46] Stuart Mesham: Hope this isn't gonna be how our exams end up
[2017/10/25, 11:01:23] Luc Hayward: Doubtbit
[2017/10/25, 11:01:29] Luc Hayward: They got the last 5 min
[2017/10/25, 11:41:05] Stuart Mesham: Right, here I come
[2017/10/25, 11:41:16] Stuart Mesham: Hoping the bio lecture goes smoothly
[2017/10/25, 11:41:23] Luc Hayward: In in m202 for now
[2017/10/25, 11:41:30] Luc Hayward: Mikki is headed to bio
[2017/10/25, 11:41:45] Stuart Mesham: See you soon maybe
[2017/10/25, 11:42:01] Luc Hayward: Yeah staying at uct till like 2:30
[2017/10/25, 12:40:37] Luc Hayward: Come to m202
[2017/10/25, 16:49:55] Stuart Mesham: For question 7 I think it's meant to be beta
[2017/10/25, 17:40:51] Luc Hayward: What??
[2017/10/25, 17:40:56] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/10/25, 17:40:59] Luc Hayward: However
[2017/10/25, 17:41:03] Luc Hayward: Howcome
[2017/10/25, 17:41:11] Luc Hayward: Surely there's more steric strain there
[2017/10/25, 17:42:09] Stuart Mesham: No there's more steric strain in alpha because the anotomendnfjjfd one is axial whereas in Beta it's equatorial
[2017/10/25, 17:43:08] Stuart Mesham: By the ansifkfjdjsj one I mean the OH that is up in beta and down in alpha
[2017/10/25, 17:43:09] Luc Hayward: The what?
[2017/10/25, 17:43:16] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/10/25, 17:43:19] Luc Hayward: Really?
[2017/10/25, 17:43:24] Luc Hayward: How do you know
[2017/10/25, 17:43:28] Stuart Mesham: I saw the word somewhere in the slides but can't remember
[2017/10/25, 17:43:44] Stuart Mesham: I saw the example
[2017/10/25, 17:44:50] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/10/25, 17:45:01] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/25, 17:45:07] Luc Hayward: Can you show me? When would beta ever be better
[2017/10/25, 17:45:19] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/10/25, 17:45:30] Luc Hayward: So beta is always best?
[2017/10/25, 17:45:40] Stuart Mesham: I think
[2017/10/25, 17:46:25] Stuart Mesham: I'm not claiming I know what's going on though 😂
[2017/10/25, 17:46:37] Luc Hayward: Weird
[2017/10/25, 17:46:39] Luc Hayward: Ask Google
[2017/10/25, 17:46:51] Stuart Mesham: You ask Google
[2017/10/25, 17:47:00] Luc Hayward: I'm busy😂
[2017/10/25, 17:47:14] Stuart Mesham: With chemistry???
[2017/10/25, 17:48:39] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/25, 17:49:05] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/10/25, 17:49:30] Stuart Mesham: Get off your phone!
[2017/10/25, 19:47:46] Luc Hayward: I've been adding to our comp sci quizlet
[2017/10/25, 19:47:57] Luc Hayward: started in the most recent test 3
[2017/10/25, 19:52:09] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/25, 19:53:17] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/25, 19:54:31] Luc Hayward: that's what I chose
[2017/10/25, 19:56:27] Luc Hayward: tomorrow after your bio lets go to like mlc or somewhere we can talk easily? not engineering unless we need to
[2017/10/25, 19:59:27] Stuart Mesham: There's this bio group project that we have to do and my group is gonna meet after bio so I can probably only come at 2
[2017/10/25, 20:24:18] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/25, 20:24:53] Luc Hayward: Chilled
[2017/10/25, 20:27:15] Luc Hayward: Yes I believe so
[2017/10/25, 20:27:54] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/10/25, 21:06:18] Luc Hayward: youuare correct
[2017/10/25, 21:07:59] Luc Hayward: so cpnfused for 11
[2017/10/25, 21:28:09] Stuart Mesham: I said DNA
[2017/10/25, 21:28:15] Stuart Mesham: And beta
[2017/10/25, 21:28:30] Luc Hayward: same but RNA
[2017/10/25, 21:28:51] Luc Hayward: but why
[2017/10/25, 21:29:06] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/10/25, 21:29:07] Luc Hayward: DNA
[2017/10/25, 21:29:11] Luc Hayward: only one oh group
[2017/10/25, 21:29:21] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/26, 07:59:15] Luc Hayward: You need a lift on to campus?
[2017/10/26, 08:03:13] Luc Hayward: And/or head to your house to study if these protests keep going?
[2017/10/26, 08:04:05] Stuart Mesham: If you could that'd be amazing
[2017/10/26, 08:04:29] Stuart Mesham: Maybe this too
[2017/10/26, 08:04:54] Luc Hayward: Hit hectic traffic because of the blockades
[2017/10/26, 08:04:54] Stuart Mesham: Are you still on the road?
[2017/10/26, 08:05:07] Luc Hayward: Still on the highway yeah
[2017/10/26, 08:05:21] Luc Hayward: Go check @varsitynews
[2017/10/26, 08:05:31] Stuart Mesham: Sho ok
[2017/10/26, 08:05:35] Luc Hayward: I think I've missed jono now though
[2017/10/26, 08:05:53] Stuart Mesham: Ah no
[2017/10/26, 08:05:59] Luc Hayward: Maybe not
[2017/10/26, 08:06:03] Luc Hayward: Might make it
[2017/10/26, 08:06:11] Luc Hayward: Depends if he's even lecturing
[2017/10/26, 08:06:25] Luc Hayward: I'm like 5 min from him if I jog
[2017/10/26, 08:06:27] Stuart Mesham: Are you still offering a lift though?
[2017/10/26, 08:06:45] Luc Hayward: Yeah can collect you for chemistry if you need
[2017/10/26, 08:07:00] Luc Hayward: Like can swing down to you after maths if you need
[2017/10/26, 08:07:14] Stuart Mesham: Oh if you have to walk back to your car then it's chilled
[2017/10/26, 08:07:24] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/10/26, 08:07:24] Stuart Mesham: It's not a bad walk up
[2017/10/26, 08:07:43] Luc Hayward: If I've missed too much from jono I'll message you to fetch you?
[2017/10/26, 08:07:56] Stuart Mesham: Awesome thanks
[2017/10/26, 08:15:33] Luc Hayward: Can't fetch
[2017/10/26, 08:15:49] Stuart Mesham: No problem
[2017/10/26, 08:15:50] Luc Hayward: But if varsity is too shit let's head back to yours?

[2017/10/26, 08:18:38] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/10/26, 08:18:50] Luc Hayward: They tried to block me coming on campus
[2017/10/26, 08:18:58] Luc Hayward: We're throwing bibs into the road
[2017/10/26, 08:19:00] Luc Hayward: Bins
[2017/10/26, 08:19:12] Stuart Mesham: Did you run them over?
[2017/10/26, 08:20:35] Luc Hayward: Nah was it my car already just sprinted past
[2017/10/26, 08:48:36] Stuart Mesham: Oh my goodness I just saw a police tank/thing with a battering ram on the front
[2017/10/26, 08:49:07] Stuart Mesham: And a swively mounted thing on top
[2017/10/26, 08:49:17] Luc Hayward: Fuck yes
[2017/10/26, 08:49:24] Luc Hayward: You on campus yet?
[2017/10/26, 08:50:14] Stuart Mesham: I'm at North stop now
[2017/10/26, 08:51:14] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/10/26, 08:51:19] Luc Hayward: Walking from maths
[2017/10/26, 08:51:34] Luc Hayward: I'm illegally parked on a red line though
[2017/10/26, 08:52:10] Luc Hayward: Hoping saps are too busy with protests to care
[2017/10/26, 08:55:10] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/10/26, 08:56:48] Luc Hayward: It's a water cannon
[2017/10/26, 08:58:08] Stuart Mesham: Oh I wonder if they'll use it
[2017/10/26, 09:24:54] Luc Hayward: What lab you in
[2017/10/26, 09:38:51] Stuart Mesham: 4A I think

[2017/10/26, 09:43:42] Stuart Mesham: Hoping to hold out until bio
[2017/10/26, 09:44:33] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/10/26, 09:44:56] Luc Hayward: Hold out till bio then head to you ? No libraries here and engineering is locked so we can't actually study
[2017/10/26, 09:46:24] Luc Hayward: Mate maths is cancelled
[2017/10/26, 09:46:55] Stuart Mesham: How do you know?

[2017/10/26, 09:50:43] Stuart Mesham: Should we go somewhere unlikely to get shutdown to study for comp sci?
[2017/10/26, 09:52:13] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm coming to NLT
[2017/10/26, 09:52:28] Luc Hayward: Yeah come here come into the lecture

[2017/10/28, 14:53:09] Luc Hayward: The meeting at UCT. A lot of their demands are very reasonable tbh
https://www.facebook.com/ammar.canani.ace/videos/955872097899518/
[2017/10/29, 10:23:29] Luc Hayward: Do you know if anybody is lecturing before Tuesday for us?
[2017/10/29, 10:43:01] Stuart Mesham: I think the plan is currently not
[2017/10/29, 12:16:09] Luc Hayward: And Tuesday too it seems
[2017/10/29, 12:23:49] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/29, 12:38:41] Stuart Mesham: I think the chem prac exam might be open book
[2017/10/29, 15:51:25] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/10/29, 16:25:36] Stuart Mesham: Yeah makes me think there's not much to prepare for the prac exam
[2017/10/29, 16:28:25] Stuart Mesham: Woah the bio pracs are carrying on tomorrow and I think they're gonna lock the whole H. W. Pearson building once we start
[2017/10/29, 16:30:00] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/29, 16:33:41] Stuart Mesham: Also Jono can't meet us in Cocoa Wah Wah anymore because they serve alcohol 😂
[2017/10/29, 16:50:06] Luc Hayward: wait really? I feel like he probably still can we just can't be meeting him officialy like it has to be a casual oh you also come here
[2017/10/29, 17:54:00] Stuart Mesham: Well he says he's moved to O'ways
[2017/10/29, 17:54:22] Luc Hayward: oh ill check emails
[2017/10/29, 18:11:01] Luc Hayward: I think it might be a religious thing for some students actually
[2017/10/29, 18:14:30] Luc Hayward: oways is better for us
[2017/10/29, 18:24:25] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/10/30, 10:07:54] Stuart Mesham: Have we learnt the Arrhenius equation?
[2017/10/30, 10:16:57] Luc Hayward: ye why
[2017/10/30, 10:28:38] Stuart Mesham: Is it thermodynamics or organic chem?
[2017/10/30, 10:28:53] Stuart Mesham: It's in the past paper and I'm wondering if it's in the test
[2017/10/30, 10:29:27] Stuart Mesham: Also half life = 0.693/k
[2017/10/30, 10:32:19] Luc Hayward: It's organic
[2017/10/30, 10:33:03] Stuart Mesham: Wow I do not remember seeing that
[2017/10/30, 10:33:17] Stuart Mesham: Did we learn about the frequency factor?
[2017/10/30, 10:33:33] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/10/30, 10:33:54] Stuart Mesham: But it's in the Arrhenius equation
[2017/10/30, 10:34:11] Stuart Mesham: Look at question 1 of 2016
[2017/10/30, 10:34:15] Stuart Mesham: In the memo
[2017/10/30, 10:34:41] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/10/30, 10:34:44] Luc Hayward: Fuck
[2017/10/30, 10:36:09] Stuart Mesham: Maybe this was another "self study" section that we didn't get to in the lectures
[2017/10/30, 10:36:14] Luc Hayward: wowow I'm never going to finish this weeks work in time
[2017/10/30, 10:36:24] Stuart Mesham: What work?
[2017/10/30, 10:37:40] Luc Hayward: maths comp sci stats chemistry all have stuff thats due this week
[2017/10/30, 10:39:41] Stuart Mesham: I'm not gonna do comp sci
[2017/10/30, 10:40:34] Luc Hayward: the essay???
[2017/10/30, 10:41:46] Stuart Mesham: Yeah the maths test is more important
[2017/10/30, 10:42:40] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/10/30, 10:42:52] Luc Hayward: i know
[2017/10/30, 10:43:09] Luc Hayward: I'm probably just going to smash one out in like 2 hours sometime
[2017/10/30, 10:43:49] Stuart Mesham: Ok I was gonna do that but I might not seeing as maths is quite ominous
[2017/10/30, 10:43:59] Luc Hayward: maths is eveything I know
[2017/10/30, 10:44:23] Luc Hayward: I have to catch up a shitton  of stats
[2017/10/30, 10:44:34] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/10/30, 10:44:38] Stuart Mesham: Good luck
[2017/10/30, 11:17:23] Luc Hayward: need it
[2017/10/30, 12:17:38] Luc Hayward: any news on pracs for bio/che
[2017/10/30, 12:17:41] Luc Hayward: chem
[2017/10/30, 12:30:43] Stuart Mesham: Bio's still happening today. I think same with chem
[2017/10/30, 12:31:06] Luc Hayward: tell me if they give you any news at bio about what theyre doing to prevent disruption
[2017/10/30, 13:33:10] Stuart Mesham: Sure 👍🏻
[2017/10/30, 13:50:47] Stuart Mesham: They made it so that you have to scan your student card to get in and there are 2 guards sitting in the entrance
[2017/10/30, 13:56:53] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/10/30, 13:56:57] Luc Hayward: ah ok
[2017/10/30, 13:57:00] Luc Hayward: goodlucl
[2017/10/30, 14:23:22] Stuart Mesham: Nah it's just a normal prac but thanks 😂
[2017/11/01, 08:54:49] Stuart Mesham: Cometh thou untoward chemistry?
[2017/11/01, 08:55:19] Stuart Mesham: For a bright futures
[2017/11/01, 08:55:27] Luc Hayward: Untoward is wrong 😂yeah was just chatting it shock
[2017/11/01, 08:55:41] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool 😂
[2017/11/01, 08:55:59] Luc Hayward: Take the next note set for me
[2017/11/01, 08:56:29] Stuart Mesham: No new ones today, I don't think
[2017/11/01, 08:56:41] Stuart Mesham: Unless I just walked straight past them
[2017/11/01, 08:58:05] Luc Hayward: Where you additive?
[2017/11/01, 08:58:27] Stuart Mesham: No that's definitely wrong
[2017/11/01, 08:58:34] Luc Hayward: Sitting
[2017/11/01, 08:58:36] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/11/01, 08:58:50] Stuart Mesham: I'm sitting up right
[2017/11/01, 08:58:56] Stuart Mesham: The late spot
[2017/11/01, 08:59:01] Luc Hayward: Good in coming in from above
[2017/11/01, 08:59:06] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/01, 08:59:16] Luc Hayward: Maybe not
[2017/11/01, 08:59:23] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/01, 08:59:33] Stuart Mesham: Whatever floats your boat
[2017/11/01, 09:00:04] Luc Hayward: How do we get in
[2017/11/01, 09:00:20] Stuart Mesham: Go forth, they checketh only whether thou art here to protest
[2017/11/01, 09:00:31] Luc Hayward: They won't open
[2017/11/01, 09:00:45] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/11/01, 09:00:59] Stuart Mesham: Oh the lecturer just said you can't come in there
[2017/11/01, 09:01:01] Stuart Mesham: Never mind

[2017/11/02, 08:26:08] Stuart Mesham: Oh damn I forgot about the chem tut
[2017/11/02, 08:32:16] Stuart Mesham: Did they give us a printout of this one?
[2017/11/02, 08:38:22] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/11/02, 08:40:38] Luc Hayward: And you can't come in at the top with our cards

[2017/11/02, 08:44:06] Stuart Mesham: As I got here, a group of them just came out
[2017/11/02, 08:44:14] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/11/02, 08:44:27] Stuart Mesham: Oh I saw the comp sci was roped off
[2017/11/02, 08:45:32] Luc Hayward: Still happening come to. Chem
[2017/11/02, 08:46:01] Stuart Mesham: Now the security guys have locked the downstairs doors
[2017/11/02, 08:51:27] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/11/02, 08:51:34] Luc Hayward: If you can get in come to lab c
[2017/11/03, 07:56:04] Stuart Mesham: I'm coming to Jono's maths today
[2017/11/03, 07:57:33] Luc Hayward: You walked right past me
[2017/11/03, 11:11:53] Stuart Mesham: Hi
[2017/11/03, 12:03:02] Stuart Mesham: We're done

[2017/11/04, 10:00:54] Stuart Mesham: How am I gonna make myself do the tutorials now?? 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/11/04, 10:14:12] Luc Hayward: Did you do comp sci?
[2017/11/04, 10:16:26] Stuart Mesham: Not any further than I had it on Thursday night
[2017/11/04, 10:16:34] Stuart Mesham: About 500 words
[2017/11/04, 10:17:01] Luc Hayward: I did ten minutes today cause I overslept
[2017/11/04, 10:17:04] Luc Hayward: 300 words

[2017/11/04, 10:17:44] Stuart Mesham: Oh nice 😂 I got a good 2 paragraphs in between my intro and conclusion
[2017/11/04, 10:19:32] Stuart Mesham: There were so many things that I said I was going to talk about in my intro that I just didn't
[2017/11/04, 10:20:08] Stuart Mesham: But you know what I did do?
[2017/11/04, 10:20:16] Stuart Mesham: I put in a reference 😎
[2017/11/04, 10:34:50] Luc Hayward: Nice
[2017/11/05, 15:05:47] Stuart Mesham: Webassign isn't even due today
[2017/11/05, 15:06:02] Luc Hayward: I know, have you done it
[2017/11/05, 15:06:25] Stuart Mesham: I did one today
[2017/11/05, 15:06:34] Luc Hayward: I need help for 24
[2017/11/05, 15:06:35] Stuart Mesham: So I have 2 left 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/11/05, 15:06:44] Luc Hayward: did you do 23?
[2017/11/05, 15:06:53] Stuart Mesham: Not yet
[2017/11/05, 15:07:02] Luc Hayward: did you do 24?
[2017/11/05, 15:07:12] Stuart Mesham: Nope
[2017/11/05, 15:07:19] Luc Hayward: so you did 25?
[2017/11/05, 15:07:34] Stuart Mesham: Wait no I must've done 23 then
[2017/11/05, 15:07:41] Luc Hayward: wow ahhah
[2017/11/05, 15:07:47] Stuart Mesham: I still have to do the 2 most recent ones
[2017/11/05, 15:07:52] Luc Hayward: ok did you do anything with spheres?
[2017/11/05, 15:07:55] Luc Hayward: ok no thats 23
[2017/11/05, 15:08:00] Stuart Mesham: Nope
[2017/11/05, 15:08:00] Luc Hayward: you have 24 and 25 till
[2017/11/05, 15:08:10] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/05, 15:08:28] Luc Hayward: Do 24? I need help…or at least tell me if you know how to do this?
[2017/11/05, 15:08:45] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/05, 15:10:04] Stuart Mesham: Woah sorry, I'm not that educated yet 😂
[2017/11/05, 15:10:18] Luc Hayward: K ill ask someone else haha
[2017/11/05, 15:10:27] Stuart Mesham: I've been working through the linear algebra lecture notes for most of today
[2017/11/05, 15:10:33] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/11/05, 15:10:42] Stuart Mesham: Will tell you when I get there, then I might be more helpful
[2017/11/05, 15:10:58] Luc Hayward: ty
[2017/11/05, 15:12:58] Luc Hayward: oh do you see this?
[2017/11/05, 15:12:58] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/05, 15:13:41] Stuart Mesham: No but that looks cool
[2017/11/05, 15:14:09] Luc Hayward: Do we particularly want to need to program in a unix environment
[2017/11/05, 15:14:32] Stuart Mesham: No... but it sounds cool 😂
[2017/11/05, 15:14:50] Luc Hayward: What part is cool to you ??
[2017/11/05, 15:14:58] Stuart Mesham: Also we already use a Unix environment
[2017/11/05, 15:15:06] Luc Hayward: Technically…..
[2017/11/05, 15:15:10] Stuart Mesham: macOS is Unix
[2017/11/05, 15:15:37] Stuart Mesham: Yeah technically
[2017/11/05, 15:16:14] Luc Hayward: I wonder if they care... they probably are inteding it in the purer sense
[2017/11/05, 15:16:25] Stuart Mesham: Also isn't the whole point of Java that it's identical no matter what operating system you use? 😂
[2017/11/05, 15:16:40] Luc Hayward: yep
[2017/11/05, 15:17:14] Luc Hayward: I think its more that you should be comfortable in a unix environment because if you ever need to ssh into a server or a remote site then you're likely to encounter unix
[2017/11/05, 15:16:56] Stuart Mesham: So that section can't be very big
[2017/11/05, 15:17:37] Stuart Mesham: It's probably just a "how to compile and run Java in the senior lab" that they teach us
[2017/11/05, 15:17:54] Stuart Mesham: Seeing as we almost couldn't do that in the competition 😂
[2017/11/05, 15:18:08] Luc Hayward: shhh we managed
[2017/11/05, 15:18:40] Stuart Mesham: Yeah * pats himself on back *
[2017/11/05, 15:37:44] Luc Hayward: is there chemistry tomorrow? or just maths?
[2017/11/05, 15:38:57] Stuart Mesham: In the lecture they said there would be optional lectures this week but then I seem to remember an email coming through saying that there wouldn't be lectures
[2017/11/05, 15:39:26] Stuart Mesham: We may as well just check after maths tomorrow
[2017/11/05, 15:40:49] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/11/05, 17:33:14] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/05, 17:33:23] Luc Hayward: Will reattempt tomorrow don't stress :)
[2017/11/05, 17:54:44] Stuart Mesham: That's a nice and helpful answer
[2017/11/05, 17:58:45] Luc Hayward: yeah, see you tomorrow though?
[2017/11/05, 18:05:24] Stuart Mesham: Yeah, did you see there are no maths lectures tomorrow?
[2017/11/05, 18:07:07] Luc Hayward: yeah bleak
[2017/11/05, 18:07:10] Luc Hayward: but they said mlc
[2017/11/05, 18:07:39] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'll go to mlc for sure
[2017/11/05, 18:08:07] Stuart Mesham: We can see how badly the test would have rekt us

[2017/11/12, 18:20:04] Luc Hayward: What's your mark now for this essay?
[2017/11/12, 18:21:07] Luc Hayward: Also someone got 100 fucking percent
[2017/11/12, 18:28:28] Luc Hayward: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rTGRQyZjCTbFhqLVtZW88eAUT_H8Ls0P/view?usp=sharing
[2017/11/12, 18:28:35] Luc Hayward: please update your mark
[2017/11/12, 18:28:51] Luc Hayward: or tell me what it was meant to be because I know you got more than 0 for A10 hah
[2017/11/12, 19:44:49] Stuart Mesham: I think they haven't marked mine yet
[2017/11/12, 19:45:14] Stuart Mesham: Because I should at least get a mark for putting a reference in 😂
[2017/11/12, 19:46:37] Stuart Mesham: My Vula gradebook still doesn't have a mark for A10
[2017/11/12, 19:50:36] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/11/12, 19:50:42] Luc Hayward: Well you have to have more than me
[2017/11/12, 20:19:31] Stuart Mesham: I hope
[2017/11/12, 20:19:45] Stuart Mesham: Did you look at Jono's study timetable he made for us?
[2017/11/12, 20:20:59] Stuart Mesham: He suggested that we start studying (going through multiple tuts per day) more than a month ago 😂
[2017/11/12, 20:23:54] Luc Hayward: Ye
[2017/11/12, 20:27:18] Stuart Mesham: He over estimates us
[2017/11/12, 20:34:19] Luc Hayward: Hugely
[2017/11/12, 20:34:34] Luc Hayward: I worked in snape today. Engineering building with nice chairs
[2017/11/13, 07:36:08] Luc Hayward: You coming in?
[2017/11/13, 08:27:20] Stuart Mesham: Only at 12 for the "bio skills tut"
[2017/11/13, 08:27:28] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/11/13, 13:36:33] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/13, 13:40:45] Luc Hayward: Oh shit
[2017/11/13, 16:37:09] Stuart Mesham: How do you integrate (sin(x))^2?
[2017/11/13, 16:37:35] Luc Hayward: U substitute id guess
[2017/11/13, 16:37:45] Stuart Mesham: It doesn't work
[2017/11/13, 16:37:58] Luc Hayward: Ok there's a formula then
[2017/11/13, 16:38:55] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/13, 16:40:28] Luc Hayward: Message Keegan he knows this stuff
[2017/11/13, 16:40:35] Luc Hayward: He'll answer when he gets home
[2017/11/13, 16:41:18] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/13, 16:41:49] Luc Hayward: But there is a set of formulae to followup
[2017/11/13, 16:42:01] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/13, 16:42:02] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 08:44:13] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 08:45:23] Luc Hayward: no its not
[2017/11/14, 09:31:45] Stuart Mesham: No it's not Peter Gregory 😂
[2017/11/14, 09:32:08] Luc Hayward: 😂did you see I was wrong both exams are going to be 3 hours
[2017/11/14, 09:32:25] Stuart Mesham: Also the procrastination got out of control there 😂
[2017/11/14, 09:32:33] Stuart Mesham: Maths?
[2017/11/14, 09:32:37] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/11/14, 09:32:44] Luc Hayward: nah I was eating breakfast at my desk
[2017/11/14, 09:32:55] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/11/14, 09:33:00] Stuart Mesham: Well that's bad
[2017/11/14, 09:33:04] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/11/14, 09:33:10] Luc Hayward: hows studying goign>?
[2017/11/14, 09:33:28] Stuart Mesham: I just woke up 😂
[2017/11/14, 09:33:34] Luc Hayward: nice
[2017/11/14, 09:33:38] Luc Hayward: tuts on track?
[2017/11/14, 09:33:48] Stuart Mesham: The bio project was due at 11:55 so that's when I went to sleep
[2017/11/14, 09:33:58] Luc Hayward: jesus
[2017/11/14, 09:34:01] Stuart Mesham: Nope!
[2017/11/14, 09:34:08] Luc Hayward: rip
[2017/11/14, 09:34:11] Luc Hayward: how many left?
[2017/11/14, 09:34:23] Luc Hayward: also I still havent heard back from maria about my marks being wrong
[2017/11/14, 09:34:48] Stuart Mesham: I spent the whole day (before I switched to bio) on one tut and only got half way so I'm gonna have to change something 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/11/14, 09:35:09] Stuart Mesham: How are your tuts going?
[2017/11/14, 09:35:15] Luc Hayward: I've been going to varsity everyday nearl
[2017/11/14, 09:35:27] Luc Hayward: forces you to procrastinate less
[2017/11/14, 09:35:38] Stuart Mesham: Oh I went yesterday but only for a bio prac skills thing
[2017/11/14, 09:35:44] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/11/14, 09:35:58] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/14, 09:36:19] Luc Hayward: yeah....stays home and lives on youtube haha
[2017/11/14, 09:36:35] Stuart Mesham: I'm staying at home today because I feel motivated (by last minute panic) so I won't procrastinate much 😂
[2017/11/14, 09:36:42] Luc Hayward: rip
[2017/11/14, 09:36:44] Luc Hayward: so am i
[2017/11/14, 09:36:50] Stuart Mesham: Eyy
[2017/11/14, 09:36:50] Luc Hayward: woke up too late
[2017/11/14, 09:37:07] Luc Hayward: about to find some more food then smash out the next two tuts
[2017/11/14, 09:37:13] Luc Hayward: want them all finished by tomorrow
[2017/11/14, 09:37:19] Stuart Mesham: Haha cram mode activated
[2017/11/14, 09:59:30] Luc Hayward: yeah... ok I'll start at 11
[2017/11/14, 10:09:02] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 10:09:44] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 10:09:58] Stuart Mesham: That he did it perpendicular to the y axis instead of the x axis
[2017/11/14, 10:10:01] Luc Hayward: ive no clue I havent done that tut yet but keegan has
[2017/11/14, 10:10:20] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/14, 12:16:25] Luc Hayward: ay
[2017/11/14, 12:34:49] Stuart Mesham: Ay ay
[2017/11/14, 12:35:33] Luc Hayward: yeah i didnt work'.
[2017/11/14, 12:35:50] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/11/14, 12:36:33] Stuart Mesham: If you're gonna learn 1 thing this morning, make it your arctan(x) polynomial
[2017/11/14, 12:36:55] Stuart Mesham: It starts with x
[2017/11/14, 12:36:55] Luc Hayward: oh for expansions?
[2017/11/14, 12:37:00] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/14, 12:37:24] Stuart Mesham: The second term is -x^3 / 3
[2017/11/14, 12:37:43] Stuart Mesham: Can you guess what the third term is? 😄
[2017/11/14, 12:38:14] Luc Hayward: x^5/5
[2017/11/14, 12:38:28] Stuart Mesham: You just googled that, didn't you?
[2017/11/14, 12:38:37] Stuart Mesham: Cheater
[2017/11/14, 12:38:48] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 12:39:16] Stuart Mesham: I just added that now, you can't have learnt it already 😂
[2017/11/14, 12:39:47] Luc Hayward: 😂 I just checkd it
[2017/11/14, 12:40:26] Stuart Mesham: I've got a trick so that if I remember the e^x one then I can work out the sin and cos ones, I'm so proud 😂
[2017/11/14, 12:40:34] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/11/14, 12:40:38] Luc Hayward: explaN>
[2017/11/14, 12:41:25] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/11/14, 12:41:27] Luc Hayward: i get it
[2017/11/14, 12:41:07] Stuart Mesham: It all started with my extensive studying of complex numbers
[2017/11/14, 12:41:35] Luc Hayward: it has to do with that eulers formula
[2017/11/14, 12:41:47] Luc Hayward: yeah have you done the complex numbers tuts? 20 and 21?
[2017/11/14, 12:41:51] Luc Hayward: theyre so hard
[2017/11/14, 12:41:46] Stuart Mesham: the way they derived e^i*theta = cosx+isinx
[2017/11/14, 12:41:58] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/11/14, 12:42:17] Stuart Mesham: if you sub i*theta in, then all the i terms are the sin expansion and all the others are the cos
[2017/11/14, 12:42:29] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/11/14, 12:42:45] Stuart Mesham: I just started 20, that's why I learnt the arctan one
[2017/11/14, 12:43:19] Luc Hayward: ah I've been going backwards
[2017/11/14, 12:43:25] Luc Hayward: so I'm exactly halfway through
[2017/11/14, 12:43:22] Stuart Mesham: So tell me
[2017/11/14, 12:43:34] Stuart Mesham: Do you know the e^x formula?
[2017/11/14, 12:43:34] Luc Hayward: need to finish up to the end of 20 today at least
[2017/11/14, 12:43:42] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/11/14, 12:43:44] Luc Hayward: without looking
[2017/11/14, 12:44:09] Luc Hayward: its 1+x+x^2/2+x^3/3...?
[2017/11/14, 12:44:20] Luc Hayward: ahhh
[2017/11/14, 12:44:22] Luc Hayward: factorials
[2017/11/14, 12:44:25] Luc Hayward: over factorials!
[2017/11/14, 12:44:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah, naas 👌🏻
[2017/11/14, 12:45:03] Stuart Mesham: Now you know all your expansion formulas
[2017/11/14, 12:45:05] Stuart Mesham: I think
[2017/11/14, 12:45:40] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/11/14, 12:45:48] Luc Hayward: I know e^x,sin,cos
[2017/11/14, 12:45:36] Stuart Mesham: Well I haven't seen any others but I'm only on question 4 so who knows
[2017/11/14, 12:45:59] Stuart Mesham: And arctan
[2017/11/14, 12:46:09] Stuart Mesham: And tan is sin/cos
[2017/11/14, 12:46:23] Luc Hayward: wait
[2017/11/14, 12:46:28] Luc Hayward: why is arctan just sin?
[2017/11/14, 12:46:45] Stuart Mesham: Is it actually?
[2017/11/14, 12:46:49] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/11/14, 12:47:05] Luc Hayward: you've written that arctan is the same as sin but without factorials
[2017/11/14, 12:47:49] Stuart Mesham: Hey! Good catch! Now I only need to remember e^x
[2017/11/14, 12:47:59] Luc Hayward: but taht doesnt maKE SENSE
[2017/11/14, 12:48:08] Stuart Mesham: Then I can get sinx and add the factorials to get arctanx
[2017/11/14, 12:48:24] Stuart Mesham: I dunno 😂
[2017/11/14, 12:48:27] Luc Hayward: are you sure you copied arctan right?
[2017/11/14, 12:48:39] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/11/14, 12:48:46] Luc Hayward: nvm
[2017/11/14, 12:48:51] Luc Hayward: I was thinking of cotan
[2017/11/14, 12:48:55] Luc Hayward: that's why it seemed wrong
[2017/11/14, 12:49:11] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/11/14, 12:49:26] Luc Hayward: so knowing ex
[2017/11/14, 12:49:33] Luc Hayward: we can use the pattern for sin and cos
[2017/11/14, 12:49:44] Luc Hayward: and knowing sin we know arctan is just take away the factorials
[2017/11/14, 12:49:45] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/14, 12:50:08] Luc Hayward: and 1/1-x is just x^n-1
[2017/11/14, 12:50:14] Stuart Mesham: Yeah so all we need to remember is e^x
[2017/11/14, 12:51:00] Stuart Mesham: I don't know if we need to know 1/1-x, that just happened to be part of that picture and quilt doesn't let you upload your own so I just left it there
[2017/11/14, 12:51:08] Stuart Mesham: quizlet
[2017/11/14, 12:51:59] Stuart Mesham: Another question, can you write sin(theta) and cos(theta) in terms of e and i?
[2017/11/14, 12:52:01] Luc Hayward: we should mashudu said
[2017/11/14, 12:52:07] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/11/14, 12:52:11] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok
[2017/11/14, 12:53:02] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 12:52:26] Stuart Mesham: Ok me too 😂
[2017/11/14, 12:52:43] Stuart Mesham: The derivation is easier to remember than the actual formulas
[2017/11/14, 12:53:17] Luc Hayward: I actually dont know the derivation tbh
[2017/11/14, 12:54:02] Stuart Mesham: Substitute -theta into e^(i*theta) = cos+isin
[2017/11/14, 12:54:34] Stuart Mesham: Basically do:e^i*theta +
[2017/11/14, 12:54:42] Stuart Mesham: Wait accidental send
[2017/11/14, 12:54:58] Luc Hayward: xD
[2017/11/14, 12:55:57] Stuart Mesham: Basically do:
e^(i*theta) + e^(i*-theta) and
e^(i*theta) - e^(i*-theta)
[2017/11/14, 12:56:05] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/11/14, 12:56:14] Stuart Mesham: In both of them everything cancels except a sin or a cos
[2017/11/14, 12:56:22] Luc Hayward: Yeah🤚🤚
[2017/11/14, 12:56:58] Stuart Mesham: So I think that's all the memorising that we need to do for complex numbers
[2017/11/14, 12:57:25] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/11/14, 13:08:19] Stuart Mesham: Did Mashudu make a list of expansions we have to know?
[2017/11/14, 13:09:44] Luc Hayward: hmm no i'd say that was the full list. Jono mentioned it in the last 500 messages on the chat
[2017/11/14, 13:41:47] Luc Hayward: some of these are impossible to do
[2017/11/14, 13:42:10] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 13:42:26] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 13:42:44] Luc Hayward: plus a whole full page mroe
[2017/11/14, 13:50:13] Stuart Mesham: That's what Jono's revision lecture was on
[2017/11/14, 13:51:23] Luc Hayward: nah
[2017/11/14, 13:51:27] Luc Hayward: I read through this
[2017/11/14, 13:51:36] Luc Hayward: they make the most enourmas leaps of faith
[2017/11/14, 13:53:43] Luc Hayward: they just happen to decide to split this and then use the double angle formula in red.

Then they clevely remember to use 1-sin^2 in blue giving them that result which they then use to get rid of the green sqrt sign (answer continues for another page)
[2017/11/14, 13:54:02] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 13:59:32] Stuart Mesham: Ok agreed, that's basically impossible to do without the memo
[2017/11/14, 13:59:46] Luc Hayward: oh well
[2017/11/14, 13:59:47] Luc Hayward: fuck that
[2017/11/14, 13:59:46] Stuart Mesham: I wonder if Nic got it before they uploaded the memo 😂
[2017/11/14, 13:59:57] Luc Hayward: nah
[2017/11/14, 14:00:14] Luc Hayward: Its 2pm and I still havent gotten anywhere today has been a total waste of my time
[2017/11/14, 14:00:44] Stuart Mesham: Oh no
[2017/11/14, 14:02:07] Luc Hayward: I want to be finished all the tuts by the end of tomorrow and have 3.5 to go
[2017/11/14, 14:02:31] Stuart Mesham: Go go go
[2017/11/14, 14:02:34] Stuart Mesham: CRAM!
[2017/11/14, 14:02:43] Luc Hayward: how are you coming along?
[2017/11/14, 14:03:00] Stuart Mesham: I mean I'm just drinking tea right now but do as I say, not as I do
[2017/11/14, 14:03:49] Stuart Mesham: I've been having lunch since 1:15
[2017/11/14, 14:04:07] Stuart Mesham: Wow where did that hour go
[2017/11/14, 14:04:46] Luc Hayward: but how many tuts have you got haha
[2017/11/14, 14:05:17] Luc Hayward: I have to finish them by tomorrow so that thursday I can dedicate to going over the paper, rules for integration and formula and then proofs
[2017/11/14, 14:05:42] Stuart Mesham: Idk I haven't done many tuts
[2017/11/14, 14:05:49] Stuart Mesham: Like 2.5
[2017/11/14, 14:06:00] Stuart Mesham: 2.5 down, the rest to go
[2017/11/14, 14:06:58] Stuart Mesham: I'm just gonna forwards march for as long as I possibly can today with the tuts
[2017/11/14, 14:09:29] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 14:11:09] Luc Hayward: is that ((1+m)^x)!  ?
[2017/11/14, 14:11:17] Luc Hayward: like is it meant to be factorial
[2017/11/14, 14:12:05] Luc Hayward: well that looks like the binomial theorem
[2017/11/14, 14:11:49] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 14:12:02] Stuart Mesham: No not factorial
[2017/11/14, 14:12:14] Stuart Mesham: That's a : at the top
[2017/11/14, 14:12:31] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but it came from the Taylor expansion
[2017/11/14, 14:12:45] Stuart Mesham: But it is the binomial theorem
[2017/11/14, 14:12:52] Luc Hayward: thanks
[2017/11/14, 14:12:57] Luc Hayward: thought that looked weird
[2017/11/14, 14:12:58] Luc Hayward: well
[2017/11/14, 14:13:06] Luc Hayward: I knew it was the binomial theorem
[2017/11/14, 14:13:14] Luc Hayward: but I didnt know about the expansion
[2017/11/14, 14:13:54] Luc Hayward: I could derive it though I think
[2017/11/14, 14:15:07] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I actually did derive that, I just had to look up the n choose k notation
[2017/11/14, 14:17:21] Stuart Mesham: Another tip: ln(1 + x) is the integral of 1/(1+x)
[2017/11/14, 14:17:59] Stuart Mesham: So we know the Taylor expansion for ln(1+x) as well
[2017/11/14, 14:29:02] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/11/14, 15:51:17] Luc Hayward: finished
[2017/11/14, 15:51:20] Luc Hayward: fuck me dead
[2017/11/14, 16:09:29] Stuart Mesham: How
[2017/11/14, 16:10:35] Luc Hayward: No just that tut xd
[2017/11/14, 16:10:41] Stuart Mesham: Not that
[2017/11/14, 16:10:49] Stuart Mesham: Tut 20?
[2017/11/14, 16:10:53] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/11/14, 16:10:58] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/11/14, 16:11:05] Luc Hayward: 21
[2017/11/14, 16:11:12] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/11/14, 16:11:18] Luc Hayward: You?
[2017/11/14, 16:11:30] Stuart Mesham: F**k these tuts are hectic 😂
[2017/11/14, 16:11:35] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/11/14, 16:11:44] Stuart Mesham: I'm about half way
[2017/11/14, 16:11:54] Luc Hayward: Wow you've gone fast
[2017/11/14, 16:11:57] Stuart Mesham: Through 20
[2017/11/14, 16:12:06] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/11/14, 16:12:13] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/14, 16:12:25] Stuart Mesham: Oh my word
[2017/11/14, 16:12:34] Stuart Mesham: This is so long
[2017/11/14, 16:13:28] Stuart Mesham: If only I did these during the term
[2017/11/14, 16:13:38] Stuart Mesham: If only...
[2017/11/14, 16:19:42] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/11/14, 16:22:55] Stuart Mesham: Nah lez be honest if we were to do this semester again we still wouldn't do the tuts
[2017/11/14, 16:23:19] Luc Hayward: Not a chance
[2017/11/14, 16:47:48] Luc Hayward: Help pop
[2017/11/14, 16:47:51] Luc Hayward: No pop
[2017/11/14, 16:48:07] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 16:48:14] Luc Hayward: Because you're notes say it isnt
[2017/11/14, 16:50:52] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/11/14, 16:50:56] Luc Hayward: So this is super important
[2017/11/14, 16:51:12] Luc Hayward: You've called these Taylor polynomials
[2017/11/14, 16:51:20] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 16:51:24] Luc Hayward: But they arent
[2017/11/14, 16:51:32] Luc Hayward: Theyre maclaurin polynomials only
[2017/11/14, 17:02:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah they are actually maclauren only
[2017/11/14, 17:02:26] Stuart Mesham: Should change that
[2017/11/14, 17:02:29] Luc Hayward: will you change the quizlet?
[2017/11/14, 17:02:35] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/14, 18:54:53] Luc Hayward: Struggling with the logic behind ln(1+x)
[2017/11/14, 18:58:56] Stuart Mesham: We have one for 1/1-x
[2017/11/14, 18:59:24] Stuart Mesham: Think of it as 1/1-u and substitute u=-x
[2017/11/14, 18:59:36] Stuart Mesham: Then integrate it
[2017/11/14, 19:00:13] Stuart Mesham: This step gives you the alternating + and - due to the powers of u in the expansion
[2017/11/14, 19:00:35] Luc Hayward: no no I know that one
[2017/11/14, 19:00:43] Luc Hayward: I'm trying work out ln(1+x)
[2017/11/14, 19:00:57] Luc Hayward: and I'm seemingly being dumb
[2017/11/14, 19:00:58] Luc Hayward: nvm
[2017/11/14, 19:01:01] Luc Hayward: I didnt sub in
[2017/11/14, 19:01:04] Luc Hayward: ln(1)=0
[2017/11/14, 19:01:10] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok
[2017/11/14, 19:01:12] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/14, 19:02:30] Luc Hayward: im gopnna throw it in the quilet
[2017/11/14, 19:03:41] Stuart Mesham: What's a quilet?
[2017/11/14, 19:03:49] Luc Hayward: quizlet *
[2017/11/14, 19:03:59] Stuart Mesham: Oh

[2017/11/14, 19:57:02] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/14, 20:22:04] Stuart Mesham: I see 😂
[2017/11/15, 11:19:53] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/15, 11:20:42] Luc Hayward: Oh I understand
[2017/11/15, 11:20:50] Luc Hayward: Tan is odd
[2017/11/15, 11:20:57] Luc Hayward: So it's area becomes 0
[2017/11/15, 11:21:39] Luc Hayward: Soon sin(t) becomes sin 0 which is 0 and that just propagates out I think
[2017/11/15, 11:22:21] Stuart Mesham: Well sin and tan are both odd
[2017/11/15, 11:22:30] Stuart Mesham: And x4 is even
[2017/11/15, 11:22:53] Stuart Mesham: And then it's an odd function multiplied by and even function which is an odd function again
[2017/11/15, 11:24:18] Luc Hayward: But isn't an odd times an odd am even?
[2017/11/15, 11:24:25] Stuart Mesham: And if tan was just tan(x) = x^3 then then tan (x^5) would be = x^15 so it would still be odd
[2017/11/15, 11:24:47] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2017/11/15, 11:24:47] Stuart Mesham: tan(x^5) is an odd composed of an odd which is different
[2017/11/15, 12:59:13] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/15, 13:00:31] Stuart Mesham: My answer was to just leave the +- before the sqrt(17) on the third line
[2017/11/15, 13:00:40] Luc Hayward: Yeah?
[2017/11/15, 13:00:44] Luc Hayward: Oh ok
[2017/11/15, 13:01:00] Stuart Mesham: But my final answer looks different then
[2017/11/15, 13:01:39] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/15, 13:02:20] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/15, 13:03:36] Luc Hayward: Theyre right you're wrong. You just lost a plus minus on the pi/2
[2017/11/15, 13:03:57] Luc Hayward: Actually
[2017/11/15, 13:04:01] Luc Hayward: You're right anyway
[2017/11/15, 13:04:07] Stuart Mesham: No what I'm saying is why do you have to add the +-?
[2017/11/15, 13:04:21] Luc Hayward: I suppose it shouldn't make a difference
[2017/11/15, 13:04:28] Luc Hayward: I don't you'd get penalised
[2017/11/15, 13:04:51] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna see if wolfram says 0 when I subtract them
[2017/11/15, 13:13:13] Stuart Mesham: Looks like they're the same
[2017/11/15, 13:14:12] Stuart Mesham: Though I have no idea how that's even possible
[2017/11/15, 13:42:56] Luc Hayward: It makes sense
[2017/11/15, 14:05:01] Stuart Mesham: But it changes it by π and not π/2
[2017/11/15, 14:15:46] Stuart Mesham: Nvm, I think my answer was actually wrong
[2017/11/15, 14:26:38] Luc Hayward: Oh ok
[2017/11/15, 14:26:41] Luc Hayward: If you say so
[2017/11/15, 20:58:52] Luc Hayward: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
[2017/11/15, 21:05:04] Luc Hayward: Ah bugger the Google style guide uses your brace style xD
[2017/11/15, 23:13:42] Stuart Mesham: Yes! 😂
[2017/11/16, 13:16:53] Stuart Mesham: Did Jono put up a checklist?
[2017/11/16, 13:17:49] Luc Hayward: For what
[2017/11/16, 13:18:16] Stuart Mesham: Stuff we need to know for the first exam
[2017/11/16, 13:20:24] Luc Hayward: Yeah.... It's been up forever
[2017/11/16, 13:20:40] Luc Hayward: Called exam syllabus 1 and 2
[2017/11/16, 13:43:44] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/11/16, 17:39:57] Luc Hayward: when you in tomorrow
>
[2017/11/16, 17:50:51] Stuart Mesham: Not sure, I haven't decided whether to go in early or last minute 🤔
[2017/11/16, 18:05:37] Luc Hayward: Same
[2017/11/16, 18:05:42] Luc Hayward: Is Dan going in
[2017/11/16, 18:40:56] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah Dan's got an exam at the same time so I'll get a lift in with Dan
[2017/11/16, 18:41:33] Luc Hayward: Ah ok, might squeeze in on that lift?
[2017/11/16, 18:41:48] Stuart Mesham: No problem
[2017/11/16, 18:41:55] Stuart Mesham: I think 😂
[2017/11/16, 18:42:08] Stuart Mesham: "On Dan's behalf"
[2017/11/16, 18:42:44] Stuart Mesham: How cramming going?
[2017/11/16, 18:43:03] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2017/11/16, 18:43:13] Luc Hayward: will tell you tomorrow by 10 if I'm coming with you
[2017/11/16, 18:43:15] Luc Hayward: its not
[2017/11/16, 18:43:20] Luc Hayward: feeling very over it all
[2017/11/16, 18:43:33] Luc Hayward: I mean I'm still working
[2017/11/16, 18:43:42] Luc Hayward: just not feeling the motivation as you know
[2017/11/16, 18:44:04] Luc Hayward: Also mashudu's answers are so damn useless sometimes that I can't trust them half the time
[2017/11/16, 18:44:25] Stuart Mesham: Yeah there are so many mistakes
[2017/11/16, 18:44:57] Stuart Mesham: Same I've kinda lost motivation because I'm not panicking anymore
[2017/11/16, 18:45:27] Stuart Mesham: I feel like I'll do "well enough" so no more last minute panic
[2017/11/16, 18:45:50] Luc Hayward: fuck yes got that one right
[2017/11/16, 18:46:02] Luc Hayward: 😂yeah
[2017/11/16, 18:46:13] Stuart Mesham: What? 😂
[2017/11/16, 18:46:14] Luc Hayward: you can almost pass on multiple choise alone
[2017/11/16, 18:46:23] Luc Hayward: I got the question I was doing right
[2017/11/16, 18:46:30] Stuart Mesham: Oh naas
[2017/11/16, 18:46:45] Stuart Mesham: I haven't done any past papers yet, I should probably do that
[2017/11/16, 18:46:56] Luc Hayward: just do the test 5 one
[2017/11/16, 18:47:38] Stuart Mesham: Is it still wrecky after 2 weeks of studying? 😂
[2017/11/16, 18:47:58] Luc Hayward: no its piss easy
[2017/11/16, 18:48:11] Stuart Mesham: Cool
[2017/11/16, 18:48:24] Luc Hayward: I'm about to start it in 5 miun
[2017/11/16, 18:48:38] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/16, 19:15:55] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/16, 19:16:02] Stuart Mesham: *Where did the 0 come from?
[2017/11/16, 19:30:18] Luc Hayward: so in case three (this) the r in e^rt comes from the real part of the number
[2017/11/16, 19:40:53] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2017/11/16, 19:40:55] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/11/16, 20:17:01] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/16, 20:17:05] Stuart Mesham: Should it be 2B = 0
[2017/11/16, 20:19:48] Luc Hayward: Huh
[2017/11/16, 20:19:50] Luc Hayward: I'll look
[2017/11/16, 20:20:56] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/11/16, 20:21:04] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/11/16, 20:21:20] Luc Hayward: It was given that y'(0) = 2?
[2017/11/16, 20:21:30] Luc Hayward: That should be one of the initial conditions
[2017/11/16, 20:21:38] Stuart Mesham: No given y'(0) = 0
[2017/11/16, 20:21:57] Luc Hayward: Really?
[2017/11/16, 20:22:31] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/11/16, 20:22:34] Luc Hayward: Then yes
[2017/11/16, 20:24:07] Stuart Mesham: y(0) = 0 and y'(0) = 0
[2017/11/16, 20:24:08] Stuart Mesham: But then I get that the whole thing is just 0
[2017/11/16, 20:24:18] Stuart Mesham: ‎This message was deleted.
[2017/11/16, 20:24:29] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks
[2017/11/16, 20:24:46] Luc Hayward: Thats true
[2017/11/16, 20:25:08] Stuart Mesham: So is the only solution here just y=0?
[2017/11/16, 20:25:20] Luc Hayward: It can't be
[2017/11/16, 20:25:28] Luc Hayward: Uhm
[2017/11/16, 20:26:02] Luc Hayward: Please check wolfram for me?
[2017/11/16, 20:26:10] Luc Hayward: It can solve this
[2017/11/16, 20:26:17] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/11/16, 20:26:36] Luc Hayward: I'm so confused
[2017/11/16, 20:27:11] Luc Hayward: I rented this question and don't tender this
[2017/11/16, 20:27:15] Luc Hayward: Remember
[2017/11/16, 20:31:57] Luc Hayward: Asked Keegan
[2017/11/16, 20:31:59] Luc Hayward: He agrees
[2017/11/16, 20:34:35] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok, wolfram just said y=0
[2017/11/16, 20:34:42] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/11/16, 20:34:45] Luc Hayward: Cool
[2017/11/16, 21:31:40] Stuart Mesham: Dan said he's leaving at 12:45
[2017/11/17, 07:11:34] Luc Hayward: You only end at 6 though right?

[2017/11/17, 08:14:36] Luc Hayward: 3
[2017/11/17, 08:14:43] Stuart Mesham: Awesome
[2017/11/17, 08:14:52] Stuart Mesham: The past papers say 2?
[2017/11/17, 08:14:57] Luc Hayward: Read jono email it says two hours if content
[2017/11/17, 08:51:04] Stuart Mesham: Can you send me a screenshot? I can't even get the web outlook to load now
[2017/11/17, 08:51:15] Luc Hayward: sure thing
[2017/11/17, 08:52:42] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/17, 08:52:59] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/11/17, 08:54:38] Stuart Mesham: Ah ok then Dan won't be lifting us back, he has a 2 hour
[2017/11/17, 08:54:54] Luc Hayward: how would we get home haha
[2017/11/17, 08:54:56] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/11/17, 08:55:03] Luc Hayward: sp he ends at 4?
[2017/11/17, 08:55:29] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/17, 08:55:52] Luc Hayward: ah bleak
[2017/11/17, 08:55:58] Luc Hayward: ok might not get a lift with you then
[2017/11/17, 08:56:07] Luc Hayward: I'll probably end at 4:30 only
[2017/11/17, 08:56:47] Stuart Mesham: Oh I can ask Dan if he'll wait for you but I definitely won't be done early
[2017/11/17, 08:57:16] Stuart Mesham: Where do you park in the middle of the day?
[2017/11/17, 08:57:57] Luc Hayward: hmm seems silly for him to wait, ask him if he's leaving right away but I wouldn't want him to have to wait for me if I ran late
[2017/11/17, 08:59:03] Stuart Mesham: I think he'd probably be fine with waiting just half an hour but I dunno about more
[2017/11/17, 08:59:14] Luc Hayward: nah its ok
[2017/11/17, 08:59:20] Luc Hayward: just now I use the full three hours
[2017/11/17, 08:59:28] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/17, 08:59:49] Stuart Mesham: Are you gonna drive up to Rhodes mem?
[2017/11/17, 08:59:55] Luc Hayward: not sure
[2017/11/17, 09:00:03] Luc Hayward: might just say fuckit and park on campus
[2017/11/17, 09:01:46] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/17, 09:02:44] Luc Hayward: you?
[2017/11/17, 09:05:05] Stuart Mesham: Might try park on middle campus or just Uber home
[2017/11/17, 09:05:16] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/11/17, 09:05:30] Luc Hayward: did you have anything from yesterday super hard?
[2017/11/17, 09:05:46] Stuart Mesham: Maths questions?
[2017/11/17, 09:06:29] Stuart Mesham: Find the area of a triangle made from points A, B and C
[2017/11/17, 09:06:39] Luc Hayward: oooohhh i can do that one
[2017/11/17, 09:07:02] Luc Hayward: you can make it a paralellogram and then half the area
[2017/11/17, 09:20:21] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/17, 09:20:36] Stuart Mesham: Have you got a hard question for me?
[2017/11/17, 09:51:08] Luc Hayward: nothing that was really hard
[2017/11/17, 09:51:11] Luc Hayward: wait this is from engineering
[2017/11/17, 09:51:22] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/17, 09:52:49] Stuart Mesham: Keegan sent me that one yesterday
[2017/11/17, 09:53:10] Stuart Mesham: Is it e^-x + C?
[2017/11/17, 10:00:39] Luc Hayward: ah yeah he sent it to me too
[2017/11/17, 10:50:55] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/11/17, 10:50:57] Luc Hayward: I'm ready
[2017/11/17, 10:51:28] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I don't actually know what else to do now
[2017/11/17, 10:51:33] Luc Hayward: same
[2017/11/17, 10:51:39] Luc Hayward: I know the proofs that I'll know
[2017/11/17, 10:51:48] Luc Hayward: I know the trig integration that I'm reliably going to know
[2017/11/17, 10:51:49] Stuart Mesham: I mean I haven't done the test but I've done 90% of the tutorial stuff
[2017/11/17, 10:51:51] Stuart Mesham: I think
[2017/11/17, 10:52:10] Stuart Mesham: "That I'm reliably going to know" 😂
[2017/11/17, 10:52:31] Stuart Mesham: I have tricks to remember the ugly trig integrals like cosec
[2017/11/17, 10:52:37] Luc Hayward: really?
[2017/11/17, 10:52:51] Stuart Mesham: Well sort of hold on let me send a pic
[2017/11/17, 10:52:58] Luc Hayward: ty
[2017/11/17, 10:53:49] Stuart Mesham: I've almost used an entire notepad of paper preparing for this exam
[2017/11/17, 10:53:54] Luc Hayward: same
[2017/11/17, 10:54:01] Luc Hayward: I had a 300 page pad last week
[2017/11/17, 10:54:05] Luc Hayward: i now have maybe 50
[2017/11/17, 10:54:09] Luc Hayward: and I used the board
[2017/11/17, 10:54:39] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/17, 10:54:50] Stuart Mesham: Step one: say "csct"
[2017/11/17, 10:55:08] Stuart Mesham: It makes a nice sound
[2017/11/17, 10:55:18] Luc Hayward: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_SjAcQeU1A
[2017/11/17, 10:55:23] Luc Hayward: csct\
[2017/11/17, 10:55:25] Stuart Mesham: Step 2: the top and the bottom are negative
[2017/11/17, 10:55:35] Luc Hayward: -++-
[2017/11/17, 10:55:38] Stuart Mesham: Thanks 😂
[2017/11/17, 10:56:03] Stuart Mesham: Step 3, the bottom 2 are sin cos
[2017/11/17, 10:57:13] Stuart Mesham: Step 4, the top 2 are like their derivatives (sort of)
Derivative of cosec=cosec cot
And of sec= sec tan
[2017/11/17, 10:57:29] Luc Hayward: csct
-++-
end on sin cos
[2017/11/17, 10:58:28] Stuart Mesham: And I just remember the big c of csct (cosec) is at the top
[2017/11/17, 11:03:42] Luc Hayward: ok so...
[2017/11/17, 11:03:45] Luc Hayward: csct
[2017/11/17, 11:03:50] Luc Hayward: -++-
[2017/11/17, 11:04:22] Luc Hayward: cosec
sec
cot
tan
[2017/11/17, 11:05:44] Luc Hayward: cosec = ln|cosec + cot|
sec =ln|sec + tan|
...no....yes
[2017/11/17, 11:07:02] Stuart Mesham: - at the top!
[2017/11/17, 11:07:27] Luc Hayward: and cot = -ln|cot|....no 
cot = ln|sin|
tan = ln|cos|
[2017/11/17, 11:07:28] Luc Hayward: yesss
[2017/11/17, 11:07:33] Luc Hayward: and then put inn -++-
[2017/11/17, 11:07:49] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/17, 11:08:29] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/11/17, 11:08:36] Luc Hayward: im gonna try this
[2017/11/17, 11:09:21] Stuart Mesham: Do you have any wacky questions you've found?
[2017/11/17, 11:09:30] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/11/17, 11:09:56] Stuart Mesham: Me neither
[2017/11/17, 11:10:12] Stuart Mesham: Have you done test 5?
[2017/11/17, 11:10:25] Luc Hayward: some
[2017/11/17, 11:10:31] Luc Hayward: got bored and didnt dp it
[2017/11/17, 11:10:35] Luc Hayward: but I was at the review\
[2017/11/17, 11:10:48] Stuart Mesham: Too easy 😂
[2017/11/17, 11:10:58] Luc Hayward: i know
[2017/11/17, 11:11:07] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna look at the test now otherwise I'll just sit here doing nothing
[2017/11/17, 11:11:32] Luc Hayward: lunch>>
[2017/11/17, 11:13:48] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah lunch 😂
[2017/11/17, 11:19:05] Luc Hayward: hmm
[2017/11/17, 11:19:10] Luc Hayward: was it right/.///
[2017/11/17, 11:21:17] Luc Hayward: fec
[2017/11/17, 11:23:35] Luc Hayward: wrong
[2017/11/17, 11:26:21] Stuart Mesham: Wow I assumed I could do arclength because I knew the formula
[2017/11/17, 11:26:32] Stuart Mesham: I was awrong
[2017/11/17, 11:26:32] Luc Hayward: are you doing the tut?
[2017/11/17, 11:26:35] Luc Hayward: its a whore
[2017/11/17, 11:26:39] Luc Hayward: one of them is wrong
[2017/11/17, 11:26:48] Stuart Mesham: Tut 19 question 3?
[2017/11/17, 11:26:52] Luc Hayward: 2 of them have the weirdest substitutions and manipulations
[2017/11/17, 11:27:20] Stuart Mesham: Yeah these are so hectic
[2017/11/17, 11:27:32] Luc Hayward: next to impossible
[2017/11/17, 11:28:03] Luc Hayward: i could do two of the five
[2017/11/17, 11:28:20] Luc Hayward: time to cook food
[2017/11/17, 11:28:46] Stuart Mesham: I should read this memo 😂
[2017/11/17, 11:29:00] Stuart Mesham: I didn't actually do this tut
[2017/11/17, 11:29:16] Stuart Mesham: I just assumed I could do the factorial stuff
[2017/11/17, 11:29:34] Luc Hayward: ahhhh
[2017/11/17, 11:29:40] Luc Hayward: read it in the car
[2017/11/17, 11:29:44] Luc Hayward: do you want me to fetch you
[2017/11/17, 11:29:59] Stuart Mesham: Will you wait for me afterwards? 😂
[2017/11/17, 11:30:05] Luc Hayward: nopew
[2017/11/17, 11:30:17] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/11/17, 11:30:19] Stuart Mesham: Then nah I'm gonna drive myself there
[2017/11/17, 11:30:35] Luc Hayward: kk
[2017/11/17, 11:30:50] Stuart Mesham: Eh the factorial stuff doesn't look that bad
[2017/11/17, 11:31:05] Luc Hayward: factorials are chilled
[2017/11/17, 11:31:16] Luc Hayward: nice to know the manipulations but everything can be done from first principles
[2017/11/17, 11:31:34] Stuart Mesham: I'll just read over the memo
[2017/11/17, 11:47:44] Luc Hayward: well fuck I need lunch
[2017/11/17, 12:36:07] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/17, 12:38:59] Luc Hayward: Huh
[2017/11/17, 12:39:15] Stuart Mesham: Those are n choose k thingys
[2017/11/17, 12:39:21] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/11/17, 12:39:31] Luc Hayward: I did it from first principal
[2017/11/17, 12:39:32] Stuart Mesham: Is this a special rule that he's using to add them?
[2017/11/17, 12:39:37] Stuart Mesham: Same
[2017/11/17, 12:40:04] Luc Hayward: Yeah but whatever
[2017/11/17, 12:40:07] Stuart Mesham: I guess I can get by without this rule whatever it is
[2017/11/17, 12:40:11] Luc Hayward: You should leave
[2017/11/17, 12:40:20] Luc Hayward: Or have you already left
[2017/11/17, 12:40:29] Stuart Mesham: I'm going now, but I'm writing at extra time venue
[2017/11/17, 12:40:48] Stuart Mesham: In the Steve Biko buildinhg
[2017/11/17, 12:40:54] Luc Hayward: Lucky
[2017/11/17, 12:41:19] Luc Hayward: I'm late
[2017/11/17, 12:46:07] Stuart Mesham: Ah good luck
[2017/11/17, 12:48:35] Luc Hayward: Getting a lift with George it's all good
[2017/11/17, 17:28:57] Luc Hayward: So?
[2017/11/17, 17:35:24] Stuart Mesham: Anticlimax
[2017/11/17, 17:35:44] Stuart Mesham: That was so easy
[2017/11/17, 17:37:13] Stuart Mesham: The last question seemed too easy so I feel like there was something that I didn't realise about it
[2017/11/17, 17:40:58] Luc Hayward: What was the last one?
[2017/11/17, 18:06:22] Stuart Mesham: Find the first 3 terms on the Taylor polynomial for lnx centered on x=1
[2017/11/17, 18:39:50] Luc Hayward: Oh that was piss it was one that we had even written down on quizlet
[2017/11/17, 19:58:37] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/17, 22:28:50] Stuart Mesham: Holy shit that's expensive 😂
[2017/11/17, 22:29:53] Stuart Mesham: Maybe the rand is just really weak these days
[2017/11/18, 06:02:24] Luc Hayward: 14k in America
[2017/11/18, 10:29:22] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/18, 10:51:10] Stuart Mesham: Yay another one
[2017/11/18, 15:08:30] Luc Hayward: We only need like 30% for chem
[2017/11/18, 15:14:42] Stuart Mesham: We're only gonna get like 30% for the buffer solutions section but I'll higher for the rest of it 😂
[2017/11/18, 15:15:00] Stuart Mesham: Thanks for working that out though 👌🏻
[2017/11/18, 15:15:07] Stuart Mesham: Put me at ease
[2017/11/18, 15:15:40] Luc Hayward: oh right
[2017/11/18, 15:15:39] Stuart Mesham: I'm doing maths today and Chem tomorrow
[2017/11/18, 15:15:47] Luc Hayward: actually there might be a subminimum
[2017/11/18, 15:15:51] Luc Hayward: and comp sci????/
[2017/11/18, 15:15:59] Stuart Mesham: On Monday
[2017/11/18, 15:16:42] Stuart Mesham: Comp sci studying is basically just SIPP + past papers right?
[2017/11/18, 15:17:32] Luc Hayward: Basically
[2017/11/18, 15:17:38] Luc Hayward: Sipp is a lot
[2017/11/18, 15:19:41] Stuart Mesham: Eh Monday + Tuesday morning should be enough
[2017/11/18, 15:20:05] Luc Hayward: Right. I’m jut looking at sipping today will startup tomorrow
[2017/11/18, 15:21:15] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/11/18, 15:21:28] Luc Hayward: wrote an exam earlier though sooo
[2017/11/18, 15:21:48] Stuart Mesham: Stats?
[2017/11/18, 15:21:57] Stuart Mesham: Right after maths
[2017/11/18, 15:22:07] Stuart Mesham: Rough
[2017/11/18, 15:22:39] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2017/11/18, 20:49:29] Stuart Mesham: Did you finish SIPP?
[2017/11/18, 21:10:14] Luc Hayward: Half
[2017/11/18, 21:19:24] Stuart Mesham: Noooo
[2017/11/18, 22:23:30] Luc Hayward: Lol
[2017/11/19, 13:18:13] Luc Hayward: working at varsity or home this week?
[2017/11/19, 13:55:33] Stuart Mesham: I'm working at home, there should be enough deadlines this week to keep me working
[2017/11/19, 13:55:42] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/11/19, 14:10:03] Luc Hayward: also I've been updating my notes for comp sci, fairly certain that you have write access
[2017/11/19, 14:20:15] Stuart Mesham: So are you an absolutist or a relativist? 😏
[2017/11/19, 14:20:45] Luc Hayward: ?? I ether don't remember that part or didnt read it xD
[2017/11/19, 14:20:50] Luc Hayward: whats absolutist
[2017/11/19, 14:20:58] Stuart Mesham: I don't know
[2017/11/19, 14:21:09] Luc Hayward: relativist is obviously cultural relativism?
[2017/11/19, 14:21:25] Stuart Mesham: But I did the excel quiz in our google drive and apparently I'm a relativist 😂
[2017/11/19, 14:21:36] Luc Hayward: oh ?
[2017/11/19, 14:21:46] Stuart Mesham: And a very non-idealist 😂
[2017/11/19, 14:21:52] Luc Hayward: the barger inventory one?
[2017/11/19, 14:21:55] Stuart Mesham: The pic is sending
[2017/11/19, 14:22:13] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/19, 14:22:56] Luc Hayward: laptop about to die then going to head home
[2017/11/19, 14:23:02] Luc Hayward: will try complete it now quick
[2017/11/19, 14:23:04] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/19, 14:23:32] Stuart Mesham: Ok 😂
[2017/11/19, 14:27:13] Luc Hayward: its so long!
[2017/11/19, 14:27:58] Luc Hayward: same
[2017/11/19, 14:28:15] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I must've wasted a good 5 minutes or something on it
[2017/11/19, 14:28:26] Stuart Mesham: Are you also a relativist?
[2017/11/19, 14:28:27] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/19, 14:29:05] Stuart Mesham: Ah join the relativism club 🤘🏻
[2017/11/19, 14:29:15] Stuart Mesham: Though I still don't know what it is 😂
[2017/11/19, 14:30:04] Luc Hayward: I think it means that what is morally right is relative to its context and that actions should be justified in order to be relevant
[2017/11/19, 14:30:43] Luc Hayward: Whereas I think absolutist means that something is right because it is right in a vacuum and that the circumstances surrounding the decision have little effect on the choices one is morally inclined to be making
[2017/11/19, 14:31:28] Stuart Mesham: Oh thanks, that seemed like a really good answer 👌🏻
[2017/11/19, 14:34:20] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/11/19, 14:34:33] Luc Hayward: Channel the LO bullshit
[2017/11/19, 14:35:12] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😂
[2017/11/19, 14:35:42] Luc Hayward: Shall we do pay papers together on Tuesday or nah?
[2017/11/19, 15:15:08] Stuart Mesham: Depends whether there are good memos or not, I guess. Haven't actually checked that yet.
[2017/11/19, 15:16:10] Stuart Mesham: I can't find them, which folder are they in?
[2017/11/19, 16:08:55] Luc Hayward: oh?
[2017/11/19, 16:08:57] Luc Hayward: weird
[2017/11/19, 16:09:01] Luc Hayward: theyre shared with you
[2017/11/19, 16:09:13] Luc Hayward: they arent in the sipp folder because theyre just general comp sci note
[2017/11/19, 16:46:28] Stuart Mesham: Right
[2017/11/19, 16:46:43] Stuart Mesham: Never mind, they are here
[2017/11/19, 17:54:34] Luc Hayward: sorry they're slow going
[2017/11/20, 11:40:07] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/20, 11:46:16] Stuart Mesham: Which ones are the absolute and which are the relative?
[2017/11/20, 11:50:19] Luc Hayward: They break down your choices and which go together here
[2017/11/20, 11:58:59] Stuart Mesham: Oh right
[2017/11/20, 16:08:56] Stuart Mesham: Let's do past papers tomorrow?
[2017/11/20, 16:18:11] Luc Hayward: At you?
[2017/11/20, 16:18:32] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/20, 16:18:56] Stuart Mesham: The memos don't have answers for most of the difficult questions
[2017/11/20, 16:19:04] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/11/20, 16:19:07] Luc Hayward: Ok what time
[2017/11/20, 16:19:24] Stuart Mesham: Err same old? 9?
[2017/11/20, 16:23:53] Luc Hayward: Sounds good
[2017/11/20, 16:28:44] Stuart Mesham: Cool
[2017/11/20, 16:44:58] Luc Hayward: have ytou finished all the stuyding?
[2017/11/20, 16:45:09] Stuart Mesham: Ish
[2017/11/20, 16:45:28] Stuart Mesham: I've gone through all the sipp lectures and through 1.5 past papers
[2017/11/20, 16:45:37] Luc Hayward: and started maths and chem??
[2017/11/20, 16:45:49] Stuart Mesham: No I'm starting chem now
[2017/11/20, 16:45:53] Stuart Mesham: You?
[2017/11/20, 16:45:56] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/11/20, 16:46:07] Luc Hayward: this is what being a day behind from stats does
[2017/11/20, 16:46:27] Stuart Mesham: Do you not feel a sense of impending doom about buffer solutions though? 😂
[2017/11/20, 16:46:50] Luc Hayward: I do!!!!!!!!
[2017/11/20, 16:47:02] Luc Hayward: But I'm a day of studying behind you ugh
[2017/11/20, 16:47:12] Stuart Mesham: Oh shame
[2017/11/20, 16:47:15] Stuart Mesham: Rof
[2017/11/20, 16:48:00] Stuart Mesham: If I can figure buffer solutions out by the time I go to bed tonight I'll tell you what I figured tomorrow if that helps 😂
[2017/11/20, 16:48:13] Luc Hayward: deal😂😂
[2017/11/20, 19:39:58] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/20, 19:41:35] Stuart Mesham: I think he's exactly right
[2017/11/20, 19:42:04] Luc Hayward: So do i
[2017/11/20, 19:42:05] Luc Hayward: But
[2017/11/20, 19:42:13] Luc Hayward: I swear there's something else
[2017/11/20, 19:42:14] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2017/11/20, 19:42:48] Stuart Mesham: You can definitely also make your jFrame without ever extending one
[2017/11/20, 19:44:07] Luc Hayward: Because if you don't extend it then it isn't an instance of jframe and so any other class expecting to interact with a jframe object will throw an error
[2017/11/20, 19:45:42] Stuart Mesham: But you can make a separate jFrame so like in your normal non-jFrame class you go JFrame myFrame = new JFrame() and then you just keep using the myFrame object
[2017/11/20, 19:47:02] Luc Hayward: Hmm yes
[2017/11/20, 19:47:07] Luc Hayward: I suppose you could
[2017/11/20, 19:47:12] Luc Hayward: So why do we do it
[2017/11/20, 19:47:57] Stuart Mesham: It makes your code maybe less ugly, I guess? 😂
[2017/11/20, 19:51:11] Luc Hayward: It's that the only reason?
[2017/11/20, 19:51:26] Stuart Mesham: I think
[2017/11/20, 19:52:24] Stuart Mesham: Didn't Charles first demonstrate it like that and then say but normally you subclass it
[2017/11/20, 19:52:28] Stuart Mesham: *?
[2017/11/20, 19:56:06] Luc Hayward: Hmm I think so
[2017/11/21, 08:21:52] Luc Hayward: may run a bit late this morning
[2017/11/21, 08:33:42] Stuart Mesham: No problem
[2017/11/21, 09:29:34] Luc Hayward: See you by 10:30
[2017/11/21, 09:29:53] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/21, 09:30:49] Luc Hayward: Closer to 10 probably
[2017/11/21, 19:26:26] Stuart Mesham: Not bad
[2017/11/21, 19:30:16] Luc Hayward: easy A hard 90?
[2017/11/21, 20:11:59] Stuart Mesham: Yeah don't think I got 90 though because I didn't have time to do the UML
[2017/11/21, 20:12:13] Luc Hayward: How did YOU run out of time??
[2017/11/21, 20:12:23] Luc Hayward: Did your GUI look like this
[2017/11/21, 20:12:48] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/21, 20:12:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/21, 20:24:41] Luc Hayward: Oh thank goodness
[2017/11/21, 20:26:27] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it took me a while to figure it out too
[2017/11/21, 20:26:49] Luc Hayward: I was so unsure
[2017/11/22, 08:53:41] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 09:00:52] Stuart Mesham: Oh my goodness
[2017/11/22, 09:42:12] Luc Hayward: hey  is vule down for you
[2017/11/22, 09:42:45] Stuart Mesham: Nope
[2017/11/22, 09:42:57] Luc Hayward: really?
[2017/11/22, 09:43:14] Stuart Mesham: Yeah, I just checked
[2017/11/22, 09:45:27] Luc Hayward: ugh i cant get in
[2017/11/22, 09:46:22] Luc Hayward: won't let me in
[2017/11/22, 09:47:02] Stuart Mesham: Want me to gdrive you anything?
[2017/11/22, 09:50:33] Luc Hayward: its ok I can do it on the mac
[2017/11/22, 09:50:40] Luc Hayward: its weird my pc wont load it
[2017/11/22, 09:51:57] Stuart Mesham: Oh very strange
[2017/11/22, 09:52:22] Luc Hayward: chilled
[2017/11/22, 09:56:19] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 09:59:22] Luc Hayward: no clue
[2017/11/22, 09:59:50] Luc Hayward: won't kf be strong?
[2017/11/22, 09:59:05] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 09:59:13] Stuart Mesham: Answer doesn't even mention K anywhere either
[2017/11/22, 10:06:39] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/11/22, 10:06:55] Luc Hayward: are you just doing past papers? or?
[2017/11/22, 10:07:01] Stuart Mesham: Wait no never mind
[2017/11/22, 10:07:39] Stuart Mesham: No this is the same acids and bases tut I've been trying to do for the last few days
[2017/11/22, 10:08:08] Stuart Mesham: I think KF is actually notation for the conjugate base of HF
[2017/11/22, 10:08:46] Stuart Mesham: Because the answer for B does a base calculation whereas in A it did an acid calculation
[2017/11/22, 10:09:01] Luc Hayward: ???????? really////
[2017/11/22, 10:09:14] Luc Hayward: ok I'm just going through the tuts and crying
[2017/11/22, 10:10:00] Stuart Mesham: Ok just take a look at tut 15 and you will hear Shia in your mind going "JUST give up."
[2017/11/22, 10:11:18] Luc Hayward: I've given up
[2017/11/22, 10:11:39] Luc Hayward: there are no fucking solutoins to past exams!!!!!
[2017/11/22, 10:12:01] Stuart Mesham: Yeah what the hell
[2017/11/22, 10:12:13] Stuart Mesham: It's like they hate us
[2017/11/22, 10:17:36] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 10:18:08] Luc Hayward: so the whole of acids and bases is only 16.5%
[2017/11/22, 10:18:47] Luc Hayward: and thats shared with equilibirum
[2017/11/22, 10:18:58] Stuart Mesham: Oh I'm work through that list from most marks to least marks and just get as far as I can today
[2017/11/22, 10:19:05] Stuart Mesham: *going to
[2017/11/22, 10:19:50] Luc Hayward: lol
[2017/11/22, 10:19:36] Stuart Mesham: But acids and bases is second on the list anyway
[2017/11/22, 10:20:20] Stuart Mesham: Yeah oh well
[2017/11/22, 10:21:52] Stuart Mesham: Wait a minute
[2017/11/22, 10:22:20] Stuart Mesham: I just realised, it doesn't matter what section you do, the marks are just proportional to the number of tuts in the section
[2017/11/22, 10:22:33] Luc Hayward: really?
[2017/11/22, 10:23:05] Stuart Mesham: Yeah most of the tuts from 16 onwards are organic chem
[2017/11/22, 10:23:20] Stuart Mesham: And there are only 1 or 2 tuts from each section before
[2017/11/22, 10:25:42] Luc Hayward: right right
[2017/11/22, 10:25:50] Luc Hayward: so just start at one end and go
[2017/11/22, 10:26:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/22, 10:27:29] Stuart Mesham: I'm actually gonna go 15 to the end first and then the start to 15 because the first half are easy so I can do them last minute/late at night
[2017/11/22, 10:30:10] Luc Hayward: right
[2017/11/22, 10:43:19] Luc Hayward: do you have tghe tuts named with tehir topic? mine are all in numbers
[2017/11/22, 10:44:06] Stuart Mesham: No, also just numbers
[2017/11/22, 10:44:12] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/11/22, 10:44:18] Luc Hayward: literally just reading methods
[2017/11/22, 10:44:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that's what chem has come to
[2017/11/22, 10:45:29] Luc Hayward: olololo
[2017/11/22, 10:53:42] Luc Hayward: yo I'm starting a google doc you keen
[2017/11/22, 10:56:59] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but I'm not gonna contribute for quite a while though
[2017/11/22, 10:57:56] Luc Hayward: ok basically just planning to put it like some formulae or like specific method
[2017/11/22, 10:59:27] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 100%
[2017/11/22, 11:16:57] Luc Hayward: so
[2017/11/22, 11:17:07] Luc Hayward: what temperatures and pressures are normal
[2017/11/22, 11:17:15] Luc Hayward: if its STP
[2017/11/22, 11:17:29] Luc Hayward: ok nvm
[2017/11/22, 11:17:30] Stuart Mesham: 25
[2017/11/22, 11:17:36] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/11/22, 11:17:34] Stuart Mesham: 1 atm
[2017/11/22, 11:17:38] Luc Hayward: its not
[2017/11/22, 11:17:44] Stuart Mesham: What is it?
[2017/11/22, 11:17:52] Stuart Mesham: 22?
[2017/11/22, 11:18:09] Luc Hayward: STP is 273K(OC) and 1atm
[2017/11/22, 11:18:23] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/11/22, 11:18:38] Luc Hayward: 25 is somethign else
[2017/11/22, 11:19:08] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/22, 11:19:27] Luc Hayward: workiung out what
[2017/11/22, 11:19:37] Luc Hayward: I think its room temp...dno
[2017/11/22, 11:19:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah probably room temp
[2017/11/22, 11:22:44] Luc Hayward: yeah because thats 298
[2017/11/22, 11:23:01] Luc Hayward: 298 is standard entropy
[2017/11/22, 11:26:39] Luc Hayward: almost 25% through feeling better
[2017/11/22, 12:16:02] Luc Hayward: fuck this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2017/11/22, 12:37:35] Stuart Mesham: Hah, you just got to 15, didn't you?
[2017/11/22, 12:37:44] Luc Hayward: not even
[2017/11/22, 12:38:05] Stuart Mesham: Where are you?
[2017/11/22, 12:38:13] Luc Hayward: around halkfways
[2017/11/22, 12:38:29] Stuart Mesham: I'm on 17 now
[2017/11/22, 12:38:40] Stuart Mesham: 17 is easier
[2017/11/22, 12:40:57] Stuart Mesham: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/11/22, 12:41:37] Stuart Mesham: My fave words of advice
[2017/11/22, 12:48:36] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 12:48:53] Luc Hayward: yesyeysyes
[2017/11/22, 12:49:03] Luc Hayward: hmm?
[2017/11/22, 12:49:20] Luc Hayward: a) it doesnt matter you won't be asked to say why
[2017/11/22, 12:49:21] Luc Hayward: b)
[2017/11/22, 12:49:45] Luc Hayward: I don't know...
[2017/11/22, 12:49:47] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks 😂
[2017/11/22, 12:50:28] Luc Hayward: c is multistep b is one go
[2017/11/22, 12:50:00] Stuart Mesham: That'll do
[2017/11/22, 12:51:40] Stuart Mesham: What's step 1 in c?
[2017/11/22, 12:51:54] Luc Hayward: protonate the big molecule I think
[2017/11/22, 12:52:16] Stuart Mesham: Oh at the double bond?
[2017/11/22, 12:53:51] Luc Hayward: hmmm
[2017/11/22, 12:53:54] Luc Hayward: yes I think so
[2017/11/22, 12:54:06] Luc Hayward: i think you protonate, bond the oh and then deprotonate
[2017/11/22, 12:54:34] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/22, 12:54:47] Luc Hayward: think
[2017/11/22, 13:03:17] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 13:04:00] Luc Hayward: yes
[2017/11/22, 13:04:13] Luc Hayward: so the oh from the h20 bonds to the positive CH you made
[2017/11/22, 13:05:00] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks
[2017/11/22, 13:35:56] Stuart Mesham: If S is in group 6, why doesn't it need 7 electrons to have a charge of -1?
[2017/11/22, 13:59:42] Luc Hayward: hmm?
[2017/11/22, 13:59:47] Luc Hayward: It does?
[2017/11/22, 14:00:50] Stuart Mesham: Oh nvm, I forgot the bonded electrons
[2017/11/22, 14:00:55] Stuart Mesham: It does
[2017/11/22, 14:01:01] Luc Hayward: >?? ok
[2017/11/22, 14:01:25] Stuart Mesham: Dankie
[2017/11/22, 14:28:11] Luc Hayward: Feeling zero motivation
[2017/11/22, 14:32:38] Stuart Mesham: Wait before you give up just quickly answer this question for me
[2017/11/22, 14:33:04] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 14:34:28] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 14:38:44] Luc Hayward: hmmm
[2017/11/22, 14:41:40] Luc Hayward: you're wrong
[2017/11/22, 14:41:43] Luc Hayward: NH3+
[2017/11/22, 14:41:54] Luc Hayward: nitrogen forms only three bonds
[2017/11/22, 14:43:05] Stuart Mesham: Would they normally include the + here (on the left where it says 2NH3)?
[2017/11/22, 14:43:31] Stuart Mesham: Wouldn't it be 2NH3+?
[2017/11/22, 14:48:07] Luc Hayward: no but NH3 is three bonds
[2017/11/22, 14:48:16] Stuart Mesham: Oh does bonding change it's charge because it before it had 2 unbonded e but after it just has a bond which is like 1 electron?
[2017/11/22, 14:48:16] Luc Hayward: But here you actually have R-NH3
[2017/11/22, 14:48:19] Luc Hayward: which is 4
[2017/11/22, 14:48:29] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2017/11/22, 14:48:37] Luc Hayward: so if you look at the number of bonds
[2017/11/22, 14:49:31] Stuart Mesham: Wait why can't it have 4?
[2017/11/22, 14:50:07] Stuart Mesham: Oh nvm it's group 6
[2017/11/22, 14:50:14] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 14:51:22] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/11/22, 15:09:11] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 15:10:10] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 15:11:17] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 15:15:46] Luc Hayward: Hmm
[2017/11/22, 15:17:47] Luc Hayward: No no you skipped stuff
[2017/11/22, 15:18:03] Luc Hayward: Wait
[2017/11/22, 15:18:03] Luc Hayward: No
[2017/11/22, 15:18:48] Stuart Mesham: The other option is that maybe by the "carbonyl oxygen" they meant the other one but I also get stuck if I start with that one
[2017/11/22, 15:19:03] Luc Hayward: No you have the right oxygen
[2017/11/22, 15:20:14] Luc Hayward: <‎audio omitted>
[2017/11/22, 15:22:27] Stuart Mesham: Is the carbonyl carbon still meant to have a + in my second step?
[2017/11/22, 15:24:01] Stuart Mesham: Nvm I think i understand
[2017/11/22, 15:26:08] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 15:26:54] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/11/22, 15:27:04] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks
[2017/11/22, 15:44:45] Stuart Mesham: Ah no I just saw a problem. There's meant to be just a double bonded O at the top of the first molecule but we've got a single bonded O
[2017/11/22, 15:44:49] Stuart Mesham: *OH
[2017/11/22, 15:45:11] Stuart Mesham: So we still need a way to deprotonate it somehow
[2017/11/22, 15:46:29] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/11/22, 15:46:31] Luc Hayward: Let me try
[2017/11/22, 15:52:43] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 15:57:00] Stuart Mesham: Wow look at that 😂
[2017/11/22, 15:58:13] Luc Hayward: best attemot
[2017/11/22, 15:59:06] Stuart Mesham: Oh well, we probably don't have to know
[2017/11/22, 15:59:08] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 15:59:21] Stuart Mesham: I can't find anything like it in the lecture notes
[2017/11/22, 15:59:29] Stuart Mesham: I know those!
[2017/11/22, 16:01:19] Luc Hayward: haha do you rememebr them
[2017/11/22, 16:01:57] Stuart Mesham: E formation = sum of everything else!
[2017/11/22, 16:09:04] Luc Hayward: you hav eto rememebr the order
[2017/11/22, 16:09:07] Luc Hayward: they only give this
[2017/11/22, 16:09:14] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 16:09:43] Stuart Mesham: Lemme see if I can do without scrolling up
[2017/11/22, 16:14:36] Stuart Mesham: I could not
[2017/11/22, 16:21:00] Luc Hayward: really?
[2017/11/22, 16:21:14] Luc Hayward: well its part of multiple choice
[2017/11/22, 16:21:48] Stuart Mesham: 2nd try!
[2017/11/22, 16:22:02] Stuart Mesham: Oh what were the answers?
[2017/11/22, 16:22:22] Luc Hayward: no I mean this section is part of multiple choice
[2017/11/22, 16:23:02] Stuart Mesham: Damn I wanted to get 10 marks for drawing these
[2017/11/22, 16:23:13] Luc Hayward: xD
[2017/11/22, 16:23:31] Stuart Mesham: Oh well 😂
[2017/11/22, 16:29:35] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 16:30:06] Stuart Mesham: The H+ bonds onto the O at the bottom by magic
[2017/11/22, 16:30:11] Luc Hayward: i like
[2017/11/22, 16:30:13] Stuart Mesham: That's what we were missing
[2017/11/22, 16:31:24] Luc Hayward: I hate this studying so much
[2017/11/22, 16:31:49] Stuart Mesham: Was hating it but...
[2017/11/22, 16:33:50] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 16:34:08] Stuart Mesham: I don't want to have put myself through one year of bio
[2017/11/22, 16:34:13] Stuart Mesham: And made it this close
[2017/11/22, 16:34:34] Stuart Mesham: Only to wipe out on the chemistry exam
[2017/11/22, 16:35:15] Stuart Mesham: I ayum motivated now
[2017/11/22, 16:39:37] Stuart Mesham: Also I should probably learn chemistry because it might be quite important next year
[2017/11/22, 16:40:27] Luc Hayward: Thats an S course
[2017/11/22, 16:40:37] Luc Hayward: look at the F course requirements
[2017/11/22, 16:40:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I know 😂
[2017/11/22, 16:41:19] Luc Hayward: you should rather check the entry criteria for the F
[2017/11/22, 16:42:37] Stuart Mesham: They all require chemistry
[2017/11/22, 16:43:07] Stuart Mesham: And both bio courses
[2017/11/22, 16:50:10] Luc Hayward: pretty sure one of them says what course they look at for acceptance marks
[2017/11/22, 16:54:59] Stuart Mesham: No they don't say but I'm assuming it's just your average
[2017/11/22, 17:03:36] Luc Hayward: probably just your bio and chem average though
[2017/11/22, 17:03:57] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/22, 17:04:18] Stuart Mesham: They don't require maths so they won't look at that
[2017/11/22, 17:04:51] Luc Hayward: yeyey
[2017/11/22, 17:50:24] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/22, 18:21:42] Luc Hayward: Yes it says you can't have acids and bases together
[2017/11/22, 18:23:10] Stuart Mesham: But the second half seems to imply that the acid base reaction will happen anyway even when the amine is protonated
[2017/11/22, 18:28:11] Luc Hayward: So an acid gives up h right
[2017/11/22, 18:28:19] Luc Hayward: So the way It is now is safr
[2017/11/22, 18:28:30] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/22, 18:28:39] Stuart Mesham: But isn't NH3 the protonated form?
[2017/11/22, 18:28:45] Luc Hayward: But if you had a protonated carboxylic acid (or just deprotonated amine) you have risk ofAB reaction
[2017/11/22, 18:29:27] Luc Hayward: Yeah but it's a protonated amine....Doesn't that mean it's mostly neutral? I dno
[2017/11/22, 18:29:42] Luc Hayward: Does lower pka mean more or less acidic?
[2017/11/22, 18:30:19] Stuart Mesham: But it sounds like it's saying carboxylic acids pKa is lower than NH3+ pKa so an acid base reaction will occur?
[2017/11/22, 18:30:36] Stuart Mesham: It means more acidic
[2017/11/22, 18:31:12] Luc Hayward: I... Don't know
[2017/11/22, 18:31:15] Luc Hayward: I'm sorry
[2017/11/22, 18:31:53] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/22, 18:31:59] Stuart Mesham: No problem
[2017/11/22, 18:32:11] Luc Hayward: Doesn't make sense
[2017/11/22, 18:32:50] Stuart Mesham: Probably not important then, I thought it was just me being dumb
[2017/11/22, 18:34:49] Luc Hayward: Hope so
[2017/11/22, 18:35:56] Luc Hayward: Thinking to say fuck it soon. I'll be at varsity from early unless you want to lift me in (if you want and go over Tut's together in the morning)
[2017/11/22, 18:36:41] Stuart Mesham: If I lift you in you'll have to wait for me after the exam though
[2017/11/22, 18:37:14] Luc Hayward: Ah and you'll be a whole hour I forgot how long this is
[2017/11/22, 18:37:16] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/11/22, 18:37:20] Luc Hayward: Rip that idea
[2017/11/22, 18:37:41] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/22, 18:37:52] Luc Hayward: I'm fetching books from the library so thought we'd end at similar times but probably not. Ok I'll be in from early then
[2017/11/22, 18:41:25] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm gonna come in late to avoid the traffic
[2017/11/22, 18:41:40] Luc Hayward: Kk
[2017/11/22, 19:06:52] Luc Hayward: have yiu had a chance to look at the notes i've started ?
[2017/11/22, 19:41:07] Stuart Mesham: No, have done lots?
[2017/11/22, 19:41:48] Stuart Mesham: Skeleton solutions to CEM1000W November exams 2013-2015.pdf • ‎3 pages <‎document omitted>
[2017/11/22, 19:42:10] Stuart Mesham: "Happy Xmas!" from Mikki 😂
[2017/11/22, 23:15:21] Stuart Mesham: Standard conditions is 25°C when you're doing the Gibbs free energy section
[2017/11/22, 23:15:59] Stuart Mesham: According to tut 20 question 6.a. memo
[2017/11/22, 23:50:54] Stuart Mesham: Nvm just saw it in your notes now
[2017/11/23, 08:37:27] Luc Hayward: No traffic
[2017/11/23, 08:37:59] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/11/23, 09:30:54] Luc Hayward: 2.5 hours what do we focus
[2017/11/23, 09:31:18] Stuart Mesham: What were those cutoffs for polar covalent mostly covalent ionic nonpolar etc.
[2017/11/23, 09:31:19] Stuart Mesham: ?
[2017/11/23, 09:31:29] Luc Hayward: Uhm
[2017/11/23, 09:31:30] Stuart Mesham: I'm still trying to finish the tuts
[2017/11/23, 09:31:35] Luc Hayward: Same
[2017/11/23, 09:31:46] Luc Hayward: I don't reneger
[2017/11/23, 09:31:54] Luc Hayward: It's on a scale of 4
[2017/11/23, 09:32:05] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/23, 09:32:21] Luc Hayward: It's like 0-0.4-2.1-4
[2017/11/23, 09:32:27] Stuart Mesham: 1.7 1.2 0.4/0.2 would be my guess
[2017/11/23, 09:32:42] Stuart Mesham: No 1.7 is Defs the top one
[2017/11/23, 09:32:56] Stuart Mesham: Above 1.7 it's ionic
[2017/11/23, 09:34:12] Luc Hayward: By seeing it in textbook
[2017/11/23, 09:34:52] Luc Hayward: I think nonpolar covalent is 0-0.2
[2017/11/23, 09:35:36] Luc Hayward: Polar is 0.2 - 1.7 and then above 2 is definitely ionic
[2017/11/23, 09:35:41] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/23, 09:36:07] Stuart Mesham: I found the percentage ionic graph on page 383 but it doesn't have the cutoffs
[2017/11/23, 09:36:12] Luc Hayward: And in that gap if it's a metal it's ionic if its two nonmetals it's covalent
[2017/11/23, 09:36:16] Luc Hayward: Oh ok I'll look
[2017/11/23, 09:36:16] Stuart Mesham: They're somewhere in lecture slides
[2017/11/23, 09:36:29] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/23, 09:36:46] Luc Hayward: Yes
[2017/11/23, 09:36:48] Stuart Mesham: Wait no
[2017/11/23, 09:36:48] Luc Hayward: It does
[2017/11/23, 09:36:50] Stuart Mesham: It's here
[2017/11/23, 09:36:55] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 09:37:09] Stuart Mesham: Just saw that
[2017/11/23, 09:37:39] Luc Hayward: Lol I remember nothing
[2017/11/23, 09:38:03] Stuart Mesham: Fuck this is gonna be my worst exam
[2017/11/23, 09:38:10] Stuart Mesham: By far
[2017/11/23, 09:38:15] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/11/23, 09:38:20] Luc Hayward: You've only done two
[2017/11/23, 09:38:33] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but I can just tell 😂
[2017/11/23, 09:38:38] Luc Hayward: Got my stats marks back already💃
[2017/11/23, 09:38:49] Stuart Mesham: Oh cool
[2017/11/23, 09:38:55] Stuart Mesham: Good?
[2017/11/23, 09:39:25] Luc Hayward: Can't remember my mark. This I got 66 or something. Got  71 for the course.
[2017/11/23, 09:39:43] Stuart Mesham: Actually either this or the bio prac, I don't really know 😂
[2017/11/23, 09:39:54] Stuart Mesham: Cool
[2017/11/23, 09:41:22] Luc Hayward: Yeah I'm happy
[2017/11/23, 09:41:27] Luc Hayward: Would have liked a first
[2017/11/23, 09:41:53] Luc Hayward: But I pulled a hard blank on normal distribution equations in the exam and left out maybe 20%
[2017/11/23, 09:42:19] Stuart Mesham: Oh that's quite unfortunate shame 😂
[2017/11/23, 09:42:24] Luc Hayward: Oh well
[2017/11/23, 09:43:41] Luc Hayward: Relying on innate memory and raw skill for this?
[2017/11/23, 09:44:29] Stuart Mesham: I don't think I've got much raw chemistry skill
[2017/11/23, 09:44:35] Stuart Mesham: So uh...
[2017/11/23, 09:45:07] Luc Hayward: Same so lots of "how did I remember this"
[2017/11/23, 09:45:14] Stuart Mesham: Cram memory, voices from above and divine intervention should get me through this
[2017/11/23, 09:45:24] Luc Hayward: Yep.
[2017/11/23, 09:45:55] Stuart Mesham: I was quite proud I just remembered the 1.7 and sort of the 0.4 out of nowhere 😂
[2017/11/23, 09:46:08] Stuart Mesham: Hopefully some of these
[2017/11/23, 09:47:28] Luc Hayward: #45IsAPass
[2017/11/23, 09:48:10] Stuart Mesham: No not for genetics 😂 ☹️
[2017/11/23, 09:56:19] Luc Hayward: Z is for ze zame
[2017/11/23, 09:56:52] Stuart Mesham: Thanks 😂
[2017/11/23, 09:57:04] Stuart Mesham: And E is the other one?
[2017/11/23, 09:58:01] Luc Hayward: yes
[2017/11/23, 09:58:10] Luc Hayward: and R is for clockwise and S is anticlockwise
[2017/11/23, 09:58:35] Luc Hayward: and dashed means into the page and the lowest ranking one is always into the page when determining chirality
[2017/11/23, 09:58:37] Stuart Mesham: Because when you write r you draw the arch clockwise!
[2017/11/23, 09:58:44] Luc Hayward: and rank is based on atomic number
[2017/11/23, 09:59:00] Luc Hayward: I just think of it as start at the top and go right xD
[2017/11/23, 09:59:05] Stuart Mesham: Not electronegativity?
[2017/11/23, 09:59:15] Luc Hayward: I dont think so
[2017/11/23, 09:59:26] Luc Hayward: because Hydrogren is always lowest
[2017/11/23, 09:59:36] Stuart Mesham: Ok I believe 😂🙏🏻
[2017/11/23, 10:00:34] Luc Hayward: yeye
[2017/11/23, 10:00:58] Luc Hayward: works the same for chirality and enantiomers(well those are sorta the same) but like with cis and trans
[2017/11/23, 10:05:42] Stuart Mesham: Is cis and trans a different thing to E and Z?
[2017/11/23, 10:05:53] Luc Hayward: not really
[2017/11/23, 10:06:05] Luc Hayward: cis and trans is a simplified version
[2017/11/23, 10:06:25] Luc Hayward: so E/Z can be done at multiple atoms along a molecule
[2017/11/23, 10:06:26] Stuart Mesham: Wait cis and trans is up and down on a chair conformer whereas E and Z is for a double bond right?
[2017/11/23, 10:07:16] Stuart Mesham: I'll come back to this
[2017/11/23, 10:08:47] Stuart Mesham: Do you think we have to remember the electron-in-a-box formula or will they always give that to us?
[2017/11/23, 10:08:50] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 10:09:05] Luc Hayward: so cis trans only works when you have two different and two of the same side chains
[2017/11/23, 10:09:22] Luc Hayward: but EZ works when there are any number of different side chains
[2017/11/23, 10:10:11] Stuart Mesham: Oh ok
[2017/11/23, 10:10:30] Stuart Mesham: Do you know this though?
[2017/11/23, 10:10:40] Luc Hayward: hmm?
[2017/11/23, 10:10:48] Luc Hayward: i would say.... I would say it would be given
[2017/11/23, 10:11:08] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/23, 10:11:39] Luc Hayward: but its
[2017/11/23, 10:11:39] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 10:14:19] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/11/23, 10:14:45] Stuart Mesham: Exceptions to the orbital rules are Cu Co and Ag?
[2017/11/23, 10:14:48] Luc Hayward: Kinetic energy = energylevel(plank constant / 8*mass of electon * box length^2)
[2017/11/23, 10:14:56] Luc Hayward: Don't rememebr
[2017/11/23, 10:15:01] Luc Hayward: have to look at a table
[2017/11/23, 10:15:02] Stuart Mesham: Cr Cu Ag
[2017/11/23, 10:15:22] Luc Hayward: oh really?
[2017/11/23, 10:15:22] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I think it's Cr Cu Ag
[2017/11/23, 10:15:36] Stuart Mesham: That was the Google autocomplete 😂
[2017/11/23, 10:15:36] Luc Hayward: I thought it was Cr Co and some other random thing
[2017/11/23, 10:16:08] Stuart Mesham: I can't see Co anywhere
[2017/11/23, 10:16:20] Luc Hayward: its 27
[2017/11/23, 10:16:28] Stuart Mesham: ?
[2017/11/23, 10:16:37] Luc Hayward: number 27 on the table
[2017/11/23, 10:17:16] Stuart Mesham: Oh I meant on my Google search for the exceptions
[2017/11/23, 10:17:34] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/11/23, 10:17:41] Luc Hayward: what are the exceptions its only 2 or 3
[2017/11/23, 10:20:07] Stuart Mesham: Only Cr Cu Ag
[2017/11/23, 10:20:20] Luc Hayward: awesme
[2017/11/23, 10:20:42] Stuart Mesham: I think they are that the d orbital fills with single electrons before the p orbital starts getting 2
[2017/11/23, 10:21:24] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 10:21:43] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 10:21:58] Stuart Mesham: Whereas they included the 3d on the next one?
[2017/11/23, 10:23:02] Stuart Mesham: Oh nvm, i think you only include the d if it doesn't have p
[2017/11/23, 10:23:07] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/RZvA67Tgo18?t=3m54s
[2017/11/23, 10:23:50] Luc Hayward: hmmm
[2017/11/23, 10:24:07] Luc Hayward: which one are you asking about
[2017/11/23, 10:24:09] Luc Hayward: IV?
[2017/11/23, 10:24:22] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/11/23, 10:24:28] Stuart Mesham: ii
[2017/11/23, 10:24:30] Stuart Mesham: and i
[2017/11/23, 10:24:36] Stuart Mesham: Nvm I got it
[2017/11/23, 10:24:42] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/11/23, 10:24:47] Luc Hayward: what was it that went wrong?
[2017/11/23, 10:26:30] Stuart Mesham: I was confused as to why they included the d orbital in ii and not i
[2017/11/23, 10:26:51] Stuart Mesham: Diamagnetic if every single orbital is full, paramagnetic otherwise?
[2017/11/23, 10:26:59] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 10:27:35] Luc Hayward: diamagnetic if every electron is paired
[2017/11/23, 10:27:35] Stuart Mesham: ffffffffffff
[2017/11/23, 10:27:53] Stuart Mesham: ok
[2017/11/23, 10:28:17] Luc Hayward: which just throws a giant spanner in it all
[2017/11/23, 10:29:25] Luc Hayward: I think they are skipping drawing some orbitals
[2017/11/23, 10:31:53] Stuart Mesham: Ffffff I haven't even looked at sunny's section yet
[2017/11/23, 10:32:19] Luc Hayward: loloololoolololololol we fuckeed
[2017/11/23, 10:45:19] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 10:47:38] Stuart Mesham: Is conformational only cis, trans and E, Z?
[2017/11/23, 10:48:05] Luc Hayward: basically just rememerb that this is A use and that you must use the R=8.314 version
[2017/11/23, 10:48:07] Luc Hayward: hmm
[2017/11/23, 10:48:12] Luc Hayward: I have a flow diagram
[2017/11/23, 10:48:23] Stuart Mesham: Fffk I saw that one, took me 3 tries to get the right answer even though I put the right numbers into the formula
[2017/11/23, 10:48:43] Stuart Mesham: Pls? :)
[2017/11/23, 10:49:24] Luc Hayward: yeah I think this specific example was really kak though because I couldn't make it work with online calculators even
[2017/11/23, 10:49:28] Luc Hayward: will find one
[2017/11/23, 10:49:59] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 10:50:44] Luc Hayward: wait
[2017/11/23, 10:50:45] Stuart Mesham: Where configurational is geometric?
[2017/11/23, 10:50:50] Luc Hayward: that one is missing one
[2017/11/23, 10:50:52] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 10:51:21] Stuart Mesham: Ffffffffff
[2017/11/23, 10:52:18] Luc Hayward: its easy
[2017/11/23, 10:52:34] Luc Hayward: constitutional isomers are same formula but different connectivity
[2017/11/23, 10:52:46] Stuart Mesham: Got that
[2017/11/23, 10:52:53] Luc Hayward: conformational are isomers that look the same if you rotate about the bonds
[2017/11/23, 10:52:59] Luc Hayward: they're the spinny ones
[2017/11/23, 10:53:07] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/23, 10:53:12] Luc Hayward: geometric are like chair/boat, cis/trans
[2017/11/23, 10:53:27] Luc Hayward: and enantiomers are mirror images
[2017/11/23, 10:54:03] Stuart Mesham: and E Z
[2017/11/23, 10:54:09] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/11/23, 10:54:12] Luc Hayward: uh
[2017/11/23, 10:54:17] Luc Hayward: ye
[2017/11/23, 10:54:39] Stuart Mesham: I _hope_ I remember those
[2017/11/23, 10:55:13] Luc Hayward: you will
[2017/11/23, 10:55:24] Luc Hayward: geometric are easy those always need double bonds
[2017/11/23, 10:55:39] Luc Hayward: conformational we know those are the spinny spinny fidget spinners
[2017/11/23, 10:55:36] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/23, 10:55:47] Luc Hayward: enantiomers we recognise
[2017/11/23, 10:55:50] Luc Hayward: constitutional is the rest
[2017/11/23, 10:56:14] Stuart Mesham: Ok I have (a bit of) faith
[2017/11/23, 11:00:01] Luc Hayward: 0. PI = MRT
Osmotic pressure in atm = Molality[mol/L](R = 0.082)(T in K)
[2017/11/23, 11:00:22] Stuart Mesham: Remember pi is not 3.14
[2017/11/23, 11:00:35] Stuart Mesham: I did that when I tried that tut and I felt dumb 😂
[2017/11/23, 11:00:38] Luc Hayward: yeah haha same
[2017/11/23, 11:00:49] Luc Hayward: they should hae chosen something else
[2017/11/23, 11:01:03] Luc Hayward: pi is a reserved keyword same as public and static
[2017/11/23, 11:01:51] Luc Hayward: Also I've come up with a (maybe overly hectic) project for the holidays
[2017/11/23, 11:04:10] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 11:05:42] Luc Hayward: Because your order 1234 is NOCH
[2017/11/23, 11:04:43] Stuart Mesham: It's anticlockwise so first you say S but then don't you have to switch to R because the NH2 has a dotted line?
[2017/11/23, 11:06:01] Luc Hayward: but it isnt
[2017/11/23, 11:06:03] Luc Hayward: its clockwise
[2017/11/23, 11:06:44] Luc Hayward: it helps to redraw it correctly
[2017/11/23, 11:06:11] Stuart Mesham: O comes before N
[2017/11/23, 11:06:23] Stuart Mesham: Doesn't it?
[2017/11/23, 11:06:28] Stuart Mesham: It has higher atomic number
[2017/11/23, 11:07:03] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/11/23, 11:07:06] Luc Hayward: does it
[2017/11/23, 11:07:14] Stuart Mesham: ?
[2017/11/23, 11:07:17] Luc Hayward: hmm
[2017/11/23, 11:07:23] Luc Hayward: ok//...
[2017/11/23, 11:07:58] Luc Hayward: not entirely sure
[2017/11/23, 11:08:21] Stuart Mesham: What made you say S though?
[2017/11/23, 11:09:30] Stuart Mesham: Shit I'm dumb
[2017/11/23, 11:09:31] Stuart Mesham: There is no O
[2017/11/23, 11:09:36] Stuart Mesham: There's a C before the O
[2017/11/23, 11:10:13] Stuart Mesham: N then C-O then C-C-C-...
[2017/11/23, 11:10:22] Stuart Mesham: So clockwise at first
[2017/11/23, 11:10:28] Stuart Mesham: So anticlockwise
[2017/11/23, 11:10:30] Stuart Mesham: So S
[2017/11/23, 11:12:06] Stuart Mesham: And electrochem isn't in the exam right?
[2017/11/23, 11:12:16] Luc Hayward: nooooope
[2017/11/23, 11:18:31] Stuart Mesham: Thank goodness
[2017/11/23, 11:14:14] Luc Hayward: this was the nope
[2017/11/23, 11:19:19] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm "ready"
[2017/11/23, 11:19:24] Stuart Mesham: Leaving now
[2017/11/23, 11:19:26] Stuart Mesham: :(
[2017/11/23, 11:19:56] Luc Hayward: rip you
[2017/11/23, 11:20:05] Luc Hayward: why leaving so early the exam is at 12:30
[2017/11/23, 11:20:14] Luc Hayward: Have you gone over sugars and enthalpies?
[2017/11/23, 11:20:23] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/11/23, 11:20:29] Stuart Mesham: Well technically
[2017/11/23, 11:20:33] Stuart Mesham: Ask me a question
[2017/11/23, 11:20:47] Luc Hayward: Can’t don’t know anything yet
[2017/11/23, 11:20:49] Stuart Mesham: I flew through the tuts so I might have an idea
[2017/11/23, 11:20:52] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/11/23, 11:21:00] Luc Hayward: I still have maybe 25 minutes to study
[2017/11/23, 11:21:16] Stuart Mesham: Good luck
[2017/11/23, 11:21:46] Stuart Mesham: When you know something, send me a question so I can answer it once I'm there
[2017/11/23, 11:21:59] Luc Hayward: ok sure
[2017/11/23, 11:22:03] Luc Hayward: googluck
[2017/11/23, 11:23:42] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/11/23, 12:05:22] Stuart Mesham: Yiss someone moved out of a parking just as I got here
[2017/11/23, 12:09:49] Luc Hayward: Nice
[2017/11/23, 16:21:58] Stuart Mesham: I would like to apply for a deferred exam on account of psychological trauma
[2017/11/23, 16:22:10] Luc Hayward: Why
[2017/11/23, 16:22:14] Luc Hayward: It wasn't soooo bad
[2017/11/23, 16:22:57] Luc Hayward: I mean question 5,8,9 and the last one were hell
[2017/11/23, 16:23:02] Stuart Mesham: I think I got about 20% for the second half of the paper
[2017/11/23, 16:25:10] Luc Hayward: Oh yea that's possible
[2017/11/23, 16:25:17] Luc Hayward: Multiple choice was good u think though
[2017/11/23, 16:49:18] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that's basically half the paper
[2017/11/23, 16:49:27] Luc Hayward: Rip us
[2017/11/23, 16:49:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah the multiple choice was fine
[2017/11/23, 16:51:05] Stuart Mesham: But I didn't know how to do any of those "show the product" organic chem ones and my chair for the amino acids thing was all messed up and then I couldn't remember what glycine was for the amide bonding one
[2017/11/23, 16:51:16] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/23, 16:51:19] Stuart Mesham: Rip
[2017/11/23, 16:51:42] Stuart Mesham: Oh well
[2017/11/23, 16:52:12] Stuart Mesham: It's in the past
[2017/11/23, 17:32:00] Luc Hayward: https://quizlet.com/_42rwa4
[2017/11/23, 17:32:16] Luc Hayward: yes yers yes to all haaha
[2017/11/23, 17:39:40] Stuart Mesham: Dankie
[2017/11/23, 17:43:19] Stuart Mesham: So can you differentiate and find the domain of ln ln lnx? 😏
[2017/11/23, 17:48:13] Luc Hayward: ln(ln(ln(x)))?
[2017/11/23, 17:48:21] Luc Hayward: that's fucking awful
[2017/11/23, 17:49:55] Luc Hayward: i can
[2017/11/23, 17:49:57] Luc Hayward: but its disgusting
[2017/11/23, 17:48:43] Stuart Mesham: It's actually not that bad just try it
[2017/11/23, 17:50:24] Stuart Mesham: Haha
[2017/11/23, 18:10:53] Luc Hayward: ye you just use u substitution
[2017/11/23, 18:14:35] Luc Hayward: right>?
[2017/11/23, 18:14:50] Stuart Mesham: No that's integration! 😂
[2017/11/23, 18:15:35] Stuart Mesham: You use the chain rule
[2017/11/23, 18:16:29] Luc Hayward: no because there are more than one layer deep you make it ln(u) where u=ln(ln(x))
[2017/11/23, 18:16:31] Luc Hayward: either work
[2017/11/23, 18:17:20] Stuart Mesham: Oh but I find it easier not to use u
[2017/11/23, 18:17:58] Stuart Mesham: You just write the derivative of the outside (leaving the inside as it is) and then multiply by derivative of the inside
[2017/11/23, 18:18:05] Stuart Mesham: Recursively 😆
[2017/11/23, 18:18:05] Luc Hayward: made a new list of stuff on quizlet can you see it?
[2017/11/23, 18:18:13] Luc Hayward: right right
[2017/11/23, 18:18:31] Stuart Mesham: The one with Newton's method?
[2017/11/23, 18:22:10] Stuart Mesham: Hey I found a derivative that looks semi important and is hard to do
[2017/11/23, 18:24:10] Stuart Mesham: Do implicit differentiation on x^y = y^x
[2017/11/23, 18:24:49] Stuart Mesham: It's basically impossible unless you know the first step
[2017/11/23, 18:32:52] Luc Hayward: called test2 stuff
[2017/11/23, 18:33:29] Stuart Mesham: I got an email for a Google Doc but it said you put it in the bin
[2017/11/23, 18:33:46] Luc Hayward: dont you do the left as dx/dy and the right by dy/dx
[2017/11/23, 18:33:48] Luc Hayward: ah not that
[2017/11/23, 18:33:50] Luc Hayward: on quizlet
[2017/11/23, 18:34:05] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 18:34:07] Luc Hayward: top one
[2017/11/23, 18:34:15] Stuart Mesham: Yeah got it
[2017/11/23, 18:39:34] Luc Hayward: do you still have all the proofs written up?
[2017/11/23, 18:40:15] Stuart Mesham: Didn't we just use the resource book and then Jurie's notes for the rest?
[2017/11/23, 18:40:35] Stuart Mesham: No, sorry
[2017/11/23, 18:41:45] Luc Hayward: yeah but no idea where they all are ugh
[2017/11/23, 18:42:00] Luc Hayward: And dont have my old test to see wehre I went wrong
[2017/11/23, 18:44:08] Stuart Mesham: Uegh me neither
[2017/11/23, 18:44:35] Stuart Mesham: Are you doing tuts?
[2017/11/23, 18:44:54] Luc Hayward: I'm going through all my notes just skimming for things to know what to focus on
[2017/11/23, 18:45:37] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/23, 18:51:32] Stuart Mesham: Did you put your chemistry textbooks in the recycling bin?
[2017/11/23, 18:51:34] Luc Hayward: you?
[2017/11/23, 18:51:50] Stuart Mesham: I'm going to now
[2017/11/23, 18:51:50] Luc Hayward: no!
[2017/11/23, 18:51:53] Luc Hayward: you insane
[2017/11/23, 18:52:02] Luc Hayward: I'm keeping everything till marks are out
[2017/11/23, 18:52:08] Luc Hayward: I have my maths working out still
[2017/11/23, 18:52:21] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I probably should 😂
[2017/11/23, 18:52:25] Luc Hayward: and then yes the digital ones get deleted and the physical things get solf
[2017/11/23, 18:52:52] Stuart Mesham: Me too
[2017/11/23, 18:53:27] Luc Hayward: Its in the boot though I dont want it in my house
[2017/11/23, 18:53:43] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/11/23, 19:06:02] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 19:11:37] Luc Hayward: or am I forgetting stuff
[2017/11/23, 19:14:58] Stuart Mesham: Nope nothing to tricky
[2017/11/23, 19:15:13] Stuart Mesham: Unless I'm forgetting stuff too
[2017/11/23, 19:20:15] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/23, 19:20:42] Luc Hayward: also what was the step?
[2017/11/23, 19:21:16] Stuart Mesham: Aaaahh Jurie dropped a dirty on us
[2017/11/23, 19:21:41] Stuart Mesham: It was yln(x) = xln(y)
[2017/11/23, 19:21:59] Luc Hayward: Wah? How do you know that
[2017/11/23, 19:25:09] Stuart Mesham: There's a rule that says ln(x^z) = zln(x)
[2017/11/23, 19:25:37] Stuart Mesham: I think they also use this rule when you do infinite limits with functions in the exponents
[2017/11/23, 19:54:04] Luc Hayward: Ah yes I know that rule
[2017/11/23, 21:02:42] Stuart Mesham: 2016 section A and B were piss
[2017/11/23, 21:02:57] Stuart Mesham: So easy
[2017/11/23, 21:05:30] Stuart Mesham: 2 section C questions looked kinda hard
[2017/11/23, 21:05:39] Stuart Mesham: 2 were just straight proofs
[2017/11/23, 21:10:32] Luc Hayward: Oh fantastic
[2017/11/23, 21:10:49] Luc Hayward: So night even finish early
[2017/11/23, 21:11:00] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/23, 21:11:03] Luc Hayward: Awesome
[2017/11/23, 21:11:17] Luc Hayward: I'm planning to go in early again I think
[2017/11/23, 21:11:40] Stuart Mesham: I might do aswell
[2017/11/23, 21:11:53] Luc Hayward: Ye come join me? Traffic was minimal
[2017/11/23, 21:12:12] Stuart Mesham: I'll just have to bring food
[2017/11/23, 21:12:18] Luc Hayward: I do
[2017/11/23, 21:12:31] Stuart Mesham: MLC?
[2017/11/23, 21:12:56] Luc Hayward: Yeah sure I went nlt today though
[2017/11/23, 21:13:49] Stuart Mesham: What time?
[2017/11/23, 21:14:08] Luc Hayward: I'll try be there by 8 but 9 is a safe bet
[2017/11/23, 21:14:41] Stuart Mesham: Ok I might just go to bed early then aim for 8 as well and do a lot tomorrow
[2017/11/23, 21:14:53] Luc Hayward: Thats the plan Stan
[2017/11/23, 21:14:56] Stuart Mesham: I haven't done _that_ much today though
[2017/11/23, 23:04:55] Stuart Mesham: Ok make that 9, I went to bed too late
[2017/11/24, 05:59:17] Luc Hayward: Lol
[2017/11/24, 07:51:47] Luc Hayward: Yeah traffic is going to make this 9am arrival
[2017/11/24, 07:58:39] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/11/24, 07:59:02] Stuart Mesham: Ok I might only leave at 11 then just to avoid the work traffic
[2017/11/24, 07:59:25] Stuart Mesham: And hope for a parking again 😂
[2017/11/24, 07:59:35] Luc Hayward: Traffic is likely to be shit all day it's black Friday
[2017/11/24, 08:00:24] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but my theory is after the work traffic it'll be _just_ the black Friday traffic so it'll be a bit less
[2017/11/24, 08:01:38] Luc Hayward: 🤷‍♂️
[2017/11/24, 08:02:43] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that too 😂
[2017/11/24, 08:12:29] Luc Hayward: It's actually not bad for you
[2017/11/24, 08:13:25] Luc Hayward: I didn't check maps and there's a fucking hour long delay  from some whore who crashed
[2017/11/24, 08:13:41] Stuart Mesham: Oh no
[2017/11/24, 08:33:27] Luc Hayward: I'm here
[2017/11/24, 08:33:31] Luc Hayward: Still Pauline
[2017/11/24, 08:33:41] Luc Hayward: Parking
[2017/11/24, 08:34:18] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm gonna stay home until 11 for cooked lunch though 😂
[2017/11/24, 08:34:35] Stuart Mesham: I became lazy
[2017/11/24, 08:35:37] Stuart Mesham: I'll be there for a 1.5 hour cram 👌🏻
[2017/11/24, 08:38:15] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2017/11/24, 08:38:41] Luc Hayward: Lazy fucker. 😂
[2017/11/24, 08:38:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/24, 08:38:56] Stuart Mesham: That, I am
[2017/11/24, 08:54:24] Stuart Mesham: Here are my proofs that I've done/am doing:

sqrt(x) is continuous
There are infinitely many prime numbers
sqrt(2) is irrational
If n^2 is div by prime p then n is also div by p
Mean value theorem of integrals
Mean value theorem of derivatives
FTC 1?
Rolle's theorem
Fermat's theorem
f'(c) = 0 then f is constant
product rule
quotient rule
[2017/11/24, 08:54:42] Stuart Mesham: Is there anything else?
[2017/11/24, 08:55:42] Luc Hayward: its in the notes
[2017/11/24, 08:55:51] Luc Hayward: please dont you want to put those into a shared note
[2017/11/24, 08:56:32] Stuart Mesham: Did you make shared maths notes?
[2017/11/24, 08:56:39] Stuart Mesham: Apart from quizlet
[2017/11/24, 08:57:20] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/11/24, 08:58:58] Stuart Mesham: There are now
[2017/11/24, 09:04:12] Stuart Mesham: What notes?
[2017/11/24, 09:01:29] Luc Hayward: thanks
[2017/11/24, 09:05:49] Luc Hayward: the breakdown of the syllabus
[2017/11/24, 09:08:43] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/24, 09:10:13] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/11/24, 09:10:17] Luc Hayward: its hospital
[2017/11/24, 09:10:37] Stuart Mesham: Wait no
[2017/11/24, 09:10:52] Stuart Mesham: I think you have to do it without lospithal
[2017/11/24, 09:11:11] Stuart Mesham: I just checked juries notes it's quite long
[2017/11/24, 09:26:41] Luc Hayward: oh so which one is correct
[2017/11/24, 09:27:26] Stuart Mesham: The hospitals is factually correct but they'll probably ask without hospitals
[2017/11/24, 09:27:50] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/11/24, 09:27:59] Stuart Mesham: It's in juries lecture 39 page 2
[2017/11/24, 09:28:25] Luc Hayward: dont you want to rather take screenshots of the proofs as you find them and add them to the note
[2017/11/24, 09:29:00] Stuart Mesham: Some of them are pages long
[2017/11/24, 09:29:29] Stuart Mesham: I'll just write where they are
[2017/11/24, 09:32:39] Luc Hayward: really??
[2017/11/24, 09:33:16] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/24, 09:33:19] Stuart Mesham: Well I think
[2017/11/24, 09:33:34] Stuart Mesham: How do you prove differentiability implies continuity?
[2017/11/24, 09:33:39] Luc Hayward: fuck that I'm not learning something thats pages long
[2017/11/24, 09:33:57] Stuart Mesham: Like FTC 1
[2017/11/24, 09:34:05] Luc Hayward: nope
[2017/11/24, 09:34:07] Stuart Mesham: It's masaive
[2017/11/24, 09:34:09] Luc Hayward: But I will learn it
[2017/11/24, 09:34:23] Stuart Mesham: But is this even a proof?
[2017/11/24, 09:34:30] Stuart Mesham: Isn't it a one liner?
[2017/11/24, 09:34:53] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/24, 09:35:04] Stuart Mesham: Can't you just say "by the definition of differentiability"
[2017/11/24, 09:35:14] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that's where I saw it
[2017/11/24, 09:35:40] Luc Hayward: https://www.google.co.za/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwinvfzE2dbXAhXBDcAKHQgeAawQuAIIOTAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.khanacademy.org%2Fmath%2Fap-calculus-ab%2Fab-derivative-intro%2Fab-derivative-intro-opt-vids%2Fv%2Fdifferentiability-implies-continuity&usg=AOvVaw2NAPW_YbKSQlW2Vq-AEQwU
[2017/11/24, 09:35:46] Luc Hayward: oh god thats the long one
[2017/11/24, 09:36:07] Luc Hayward: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-derivative-intro/ab-derivative-intro-opt-vids/v/differentiability-implies-continuity
[2017/11/24, 09:36:37] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/11/24, 09:39:47] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/24, 09:46:26] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/11/24, 10:02:04] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/24, 10:02:17] Luc Hayward: HMM
[2017/11/24, 10:02:34] Luc Hayward: 1]
[2017/11/24, 10:02:41] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/11/24, 10:02:44] Luc Hayward: yeah 1
[2017/11/24, 10:02:54] Stuart Mesham: nope
[2017/11/24, 10:03:51] Luc Hayward: wait
[2017/11/24, 10:04:22] Luc Hayward: desmos says its just infinity
[2017/11/24, 10:04:27] Luc Hayward: that makes no sense
[2017/11/24, 10:05:13] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/11/24, 10:04:50] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/24, 10:05:23] Luc Hayward: its 20
[2017/11/24, 10:05:29] Luc Hayward: how the fuck do you make it 20
[2017/11/24, 10:06:17] Luc Hayward: I would never have known that
[2017/11/24, 10:05:40] Stuart Mesham: e^3 is approx 20
[2017/11/24, 10:07:53] Luc Hayward: you have theorems in the note that we dont need to learn
[2017/11/24, 10:06:48] Stuart Mesham: You don't have to know that e^3 is 20
[2017/11/24, 10:06:54] Stuart Mesham: You just have to say e^3
[2017/11/24, 10:08:19] Luc Hayward: yeah I know but Id never have remembered that 1 + 1/n)^n = e
[2017/11/24, 10:08:14] Stuart Mesham: Which?
[2017/11/24, 10:08:31] Luc Hayward: like infinitely many prime number theorem
[2017/11/24, 10:08:35] Luc Hayward: its not part of the list
[2017/11/24, 10:08:44] Stuart Mesham: Me neither
[2017/11/24, 10:09:11] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2017/11/24, 10:10:11] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/11/24, 10:10:17] Luc Hayward: its a common proof by contradiciton
[2017/11/24, 10:10:11] Stuart Mesham: Can you prove that log(base 10)(3) is irrational? (from past paper)
[2017/11/24, 10:10:39] Luc Hayward: you do it using contradiciton
[2017/11/24, 10:10:42] Luc Hayward: uhm
[2017/11/24, 10:10:38] Stuart Mesham: But have you done it?
[2017/11/24, 10:10:54] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/11/24, 10:10:56] Luc Hayward: I can try it?
[2017/11/24, 10:11:34] Luc Hayward: come to varsity and work here??
[2017/11/24, 10:11:03] Stuart Mesham: Try it
[2017/11/24, 10:11:17] Stuart Mesham: It's really simple but I couldn't figure it out 😂
[2017/11/24, 10:12:52] Stuart Mesham: No it's almost lunch time
[2017/11/24, 10:12:58] Stuart Mesham: That's what I'm here for
[2017/11/24, 10:14:41] Luc Hayward: I don't know I'd have to remind myself of the proof for the swrt of 2
[2017/11/24, 10:15:06] Stuart Mesham: It's slightly different to sqrt(2) proof
[2017/11/24, 10:15:20] Stuart Mesham: it was 2016 C2
[2017/11/24, 10:16:27] Luc Hayward: can you send me the answer? just screenshot it cant be that long
[2017/11/24, 10:17:01] Stuart Mesham: I don't have the memo open
[2017/11/24, 10:17:47] Luc Hayward: ?
[2017/11/24, 10:17:52] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/11/24, 10:18:28] Stuart Mesham: Did it last night
[2017/11/24, 10:19:49] Luc Hayward: oh ok I'm doing it now
[2017/11/24, 10:19:54] Luc Hayward: will check the memo
[2017/11/24, 10:20:05] Luc Hayward: feel like I've gone wrong I saw they used like 4 lines
[2017/11/24, 10:22:16] Luc Hayward: ok I got it
[2017/11/24, 10:22:29] Luc Hayward: I just didnt know how to show that the end step cannot be true
[2017/11/24, 10:22:50] Luc Hayward: I forgot that 3^n was odd for all n
[2017/11/24, 10:22:48] Stuart Mesham: Yeah same
[2017/11/24, 10:23:00] Luc Hayward: thats actually nicer than sqrt2
[2017/11/24, 10:23:08] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/24, 10:23:19] Luc Hayward: also I'm writing on chemistry notes
[2017/11/24, 10:23:23] Luc Hayward: entropy is increasing
[2017/11/24, 10:23:50] Stuart Mesham: Rough 😂
[2017/11/24, 10:24:00] Stuart Mesham: Did you run out of paper?
[2017/11/24, 10:24:59] Luc Hayward: Apparently I forgot mine at home:/
[2017/11/24, 10:26:00] Luc Hayward: hmmm
[2017/11/24, 10:27:03] Luc Hayward: I have made a mistake...
[2017/11/24, 10:27:41] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/11/24, 10:28:48] Luc Hayward: ohhh
[2017/11/24, 10:29:07] Luc Hayward: I forgotn to say that p and q (for p/q) has no common factors
[2017/11/24, 10:36:05] Stuart Mesham: Ah Dan just told me roadworks on Rhodes drive (from my house) 🙁
[2017/11/24, 10:36:13] Luc Hayward: lololololol
[2017/11/24, 10:43:54] Stuart Mesham: You NLT or MLC?
[2017/11/24, 10:44:14] Luc Hayward: nlt
[2017/11/24, 10:44:59] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'm gonna have lunch then come
[2017/11/24, 10:45:26] Stuart Mesham: If you hear protesters coming just lock all the doors and pretend you didn't do anything
[2017/11/24, 10:48:52] Luc Hayward: when are there ever protestors??
[2017/11/24, 10:49:03] Luc Hayward: literally no protests in like 2 weeks
[2017/11/24, 11:07:04] Stuart Mesham: Jk
[2017/11/24, 11:07:37] Stuart Mesham: Let's go to the MLC though, the NLT desks are too thin
[2017/11/24, 11:08:23] Luc Hayward: nah I don't want my bag with me in the exam so I walk back to drop it at my car, not walking the extra distance for mlc. We can go downstairs if you struggle
[2017/11/24, 11:10:36] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2017/11/25, 13:38:50] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/25, 13:49:25] Luc Hayward: Hey man how was it?
[2017/11/25, 14:22:25] Stuart Mesham: Hi
[2017/11/25, 14:22:29] Stuart Mesham: Not bad
[2017/11/25, 14:23:05] Stuart Mesham: I was happy with the proof at the end
[2017/11/25, 14:23:21] Stuart Mesham: And the rest mostly fine
[2017/11/25, 14:23:37] Stuart Mesham: Just the optimisation was a bit weird
[2017/11/25, 14:24:23] Stuart Mesham: And my graph had some contradictions in it 🤦🏻‍♂😂
[2017/11/25, 14:25:48] Stuart Mesham: There was an asymptote that it wasn't meant to cross but I couldn't draw it without it crossing the asymptote so I just drew an arrow pointing to where it crossed saying "doesn't cross the asymptote" 😂
[2017/11/25, 18:23:57] Luc Hayward: Couldn't remember it at all
[2017/11/25, 18:24:10] Luc Hayward: I got x=o which is so wrong
[2017/11/25, 18:24:20] Luc Hayward: Yeah I feel you but oh well
[2017/11/25, 18:43:30] Stuart Mesham: Yeah no more maths anyway
[2017/11/25, 18:58:01] Luc Hayward: Oh well
[2017/11/25, 18:58:16] Luc Hayward: How you feeling for next week
[2017/11/25, 19:00:07] Stuart Mesham: Ugh
[2017/11/25, 19:00:46] Stuart Mesham: Got 3 days to learn 6 sections of bio (rekt) :(
[2017/11/25, 21:56:25] Luc Hayward: You got this
[2017/11/25, 21:57:19] Stuart Mesham: Thanks for the belief 🙏🏻
[2017/11/25, 21:57:26] Luc Hayward: Full belief
[2017/11/25, 21:59:18] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2017/11/25, 22:00:12] Stuart Mesham: I might be away
[2017/11/25, 22:00:22] Luc Hayward: Oh rip and no wi-fi
[2017/11/25, 22:01:09] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/26, 06:22:23] Luc Hayward: Ay what did you use when writing your messenger program? Did you have a specific tut or did you just work off a general guide for socket programming
[2017/11/26, 08:45:04] Stuart Mesham: Nah I wasn't following a tut
[2017/11/26, 08:45:35] Stuart Mesham: First learn about sockets then about multithreading
[2017/11/26, 08:49:18] Stuart Mesham: The basic idea was: on the server, have one thread listening for new clients connecting. Each time a client connects it makes a new thread for recieving messages from that client.

On the client, when you connect to the server make a new thread for recieving messages from the server.
[2017/11/26, 08:50:37] Stuart Mesham: For sending messages you can probably just start a short lived thread each time the user presses send
[2017/11/26, 08:52:36] Stuart Mesham: Oh and for the chat room with many users you'll need to make the server forward each message it receives to all the other clients
[2017/11/26, 12:35:31] Luc Hayward: This was the plan
[2017/11/26, 12:38:49] Luc Hayward: Not thinking clearly but why do you need a unique thread per client connecting to the server? Or are those threads just idly waiting for new messages and then passing the message off to the main thread? Surely one thread could listen for all clients and each client has a unique code that they put at the start of the message ?
[2017/11/26, 14:31:57] Stuart Mesham: The second thing, each thread just waiting for the next message from a client
[2017/11/26, 14:36:00] Stuart Mesham: For the last thing TCP has to be between only 2 machines (I think) so to do it like this you'd have to use UDP (using multicast sockets I think) but then some messages might not come through
[2017/11/26, 18:11:15] Luc Hayward: Is that necessary/convention? because surely you could just do it where each message carries an identifier (Yes I know that causes issues)
[2017/11/26, 18:12:49] Luc Hayward: I thought UDP was the better way to do it ??
[2017/11/26, 18:13:05] Luc Hayward: And then you can tell the client that you received the message
[2017/11/26, 18:15:13] Stuart Mesham: Nah UDP is the "don't care if it gets there, don't care what order the get there" but TCP is the "make sure that they get there, make sure that they get there in the right order" one
[2017/11/26, 18:17:59] Stuart Mesham: Just try make a Java message thing, it'll make more sense once you've tried it
[2017/11/26, 18:18:24] Stuart Mesham: I think there's even an official oracle tutorial
[2017/11/26, 18:18:25] Luc Hayward: ok will do
[2017/11/26, 18:18:34] Luc Hayward: yeah there is but its official oravle trash
[2017/11/26, 18:18:45] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2017/11/26, 18:18:47] Luc Hayward: right ok
[2017/11/26, 18:19:01] Luc Hayward: thats strange I thought UDP is what was used for games?
[2017/11/26, 18:19:19] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it is but in games you don't care if it gets there etc.
[2017/11/26, 18:19:47] Luc Hayward: Oh right because you just care that the latest stuff gets through and if you miss a couple packets its chilled?
[2017/11/26, 18:20:36] Stuart Mesham: Yeah because if you drop a packet somewhere you don't really care because it's old info anyway
[2017/11/26, 18:21:15] Stuart Mesham: So if you were using TCP it would keep trying to resend that one until it went through, which you don't want
[2017/11/26, 18:23:11] Luc Hayward: right right right
[2017/11/26, 18:23:12] Luc Hayward: ok
[2017/11/26, 18:23:14] Luc Hayward: awesome
[2017/11/26, 18:24:26] Luc Hayward: will take a lok
[2017/11/26, 18:27:56] Stuart Mesham: I think my old message thing was still in my netbeans projects folder so it might make sense to look at that
[2017/11/26, 18:28:38] Stuart Mesham: Though look at the simpler one not the many users one, that one's a bit complicated
[2017/11/26, 18:33:37] Stuart Mesham: Actually don't look at it, I don't think the old one is there 😂
[2017/11/26, 18:33:55] Luc Hayward: I have it yes
[2017/11/26, 18:34:03] Luc Hayward: I dnp
[2017/11/26, 18:55:03] Luc Hayward: will keep you updated
[2017/11/26, 21:01:31] Stuart Mesham: Cool cool
[2017/11/26, 22:16:15] Luc Hayward: Might only start in a day or two all I did today was burn at the beach
[2017/11/26, 22:18:57] Luc Hayward: I learned what cubic redundancy checks are though
[2017/11/26, 22:19:05] Luc Hayward: Reneger that thing I looked up at your house
[2017/11/26, 22:19:07] Stuart Mesham: Haha sand
[2017/11/26, 22:19:19] Stuart Mesham: Oh 😂
[2017/11/26, 22:19:47] Luc Hayward: It's an error checking method (checking for corrupted data)
[2017/11/26, 22:20:19] Stuart Mesham: How peculiar 😂
[2017/11/26, 22:21:10] Luc Hayward: Thinking I'm going to recreate a single user system then create a multi user chat room. And then take it from there (staying in Java for now)
[2017/11/26, 22:21:27] Luc Hayward: Because then I have your projects as reference for debugging if needed
[2017/11/26, 22:21:58] Stuart Mesham: Yeah do that
[2017/11/26, 22:22:26] Stuart Mesham: I hope you tested MessageClient3
[2017/11/26, 22:23:00] Luc Hayward: Nah nothing yet
[2017/11/26, 22:22:59] Stuart Mesham: It's like the other one but better 😏
[2017/11/26, 22:23:37] Luc Hayward: Holly's parents were away this weekend so she was staying at my place so I've used a computer for about an hour all weekend
[2017/11/26, 22:24:03] Stuart Mesham: Ooh tough life
[2017/11/26, 22:24:13] Luc Hayward: Could be worse😂
[2017/11/26, 22:24:26] Stuart Mesham: It could indeed 😂
[2017/11/26, 22:24:35] Luc Hayward: Question is do I do this in a million projects like you used to do
[2017/11/26, 22:24:57] Luc Hayward: Or do I do it as a single project and use git to show different versions
[2017/11/26, 22:24:57] Stuart Mesham: I watched the incdedibles trailer today
[2017/11/26, 22:25:05] Luc Hayward: Hehe😂😂
[2017/11/26, 22:25:14] Luc Hayward: YOU HAVE POWERS
[2017/11/26, 22:25:22] Stuart Mesham: It's beautiful😂
[2017/11/26, 22:27:15] Luc Hayward: <‎GIF omitted>
[2017/11/26, 22:27:23] Luc Hayward: But yeah
[2017/11/26, 22:30:10] Stuart Mesham: Easy but ratchet vs pro but kinda effortful 🤷🏻‍♂
[2017/11/26, 22:31:29] Luc Hayward: The first one very impressive until people realise it's effectively project A.0, A.1, A.3. 😂
[2017/11/26, 22:31:49] Luc Hayward: Archive one looks less impressive but Kris things heat, clean and maintainable.
[2017/11/27, 09:35:35] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2017/11/28, 13:48:56] Luc Hayward: My PAT documentation is 155 pages long
[2017/11/28, 13:51:10] Luc Hayward: lol
[2017/11/28, 13:51:13] Luc Hayward: 178 pages
[2017/11/28, 13:51:19] Luc Hayward: 20314 words
[2017/11/28, 13:54:54] Stuart Mesham: Oooh I remember that thing... What a grind
[2017/11/28, 17:28:48] Luc Hayward: Exam tomorrow?
[2017/11/28, 17:40:46] Stuart Mesham: Yep
[2017/11/28, 17:40:51] Stuart Mesham: Bio theory
[2017/11/28, 17:40:52] Luc Hayward: Ready?
[2017/11/28, 17:41:25] Stuart Mesham: Well... you know bio 🤦🏻‍♂
[2017/11/28, 17:41:38] Stuart Mesham: I've read all the notes at least 🤷🏼‍♂
[2017/11/28, 17:43:00] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2017/11/28, 17:44:42] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'm at the "ready to go to sleep and just accept whatever happens" stage 😂
[2017/11/28, 17:44:53] Luc Hayward: This
[2017/11/29, 20:33:26] Luc Hayward: Are you considering tutoring for the varsity next year in the chino sci department?
[2017/11/29, 20:49:10] Stuart Mesham: No
[2017/11/29, 20:49:27] Stuart Mesham: I'm clearly not very charitable 😂
[2017/11/29, 20:50:19] Stuart Mesham: The tutors have to mark the assignments, don't they?
[2017/11/29, 20:52:24] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2017/11/29, 20:52:29] Luc Hayward: Not sure what theure paid
[2017/11/29, 20:53:03] Stuart Mesham: I think it's mostly for brownie points with the comp sci department
[2017/11/29, 20:53:20] Luc Hayward: I don't give a flying monkey I just want cash
[2017/11/29, 20:53:31] Stuart Mesham: Yeah same 😂
[2017/11/29, 20:53:54] Luc Hayward: Ask Matthew or Jeremy if they know what the pay is?
[2017/11/29, 20:54:57] Stuart Mesham: I'll ask Matthew but I think they did maths tutoring and not comp sci
[2017/11/29, 20:56:03] Luc Hayward: Ah
[2017/11/29, 20:56:35] Stuart Mesham: Hey guess what it is tomorrow?
[2017/11/29, 20:57:07] Stuart Mesham: Basically attempt 2 at the test I failed
[2017/11/29, 20:57:15] Stuart Mesham: I'm ready for it though
[2017/11/29, 20:57:54] Stuart Mesham: I think I found a way around the rash question
[2017/11/29, 21:16:27] Luc Hayward: 😂good luck
[2017/11/29, 21:21:19] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2017/11/29, 21:28:53] Luc Hayward: You got this
[2017/11/29, 21:30:01] Luc Hayward: Took a break from coding today to reinstall windows on the desktop and download and setup a notable USB with Ubuntu on it (and added a persistence partition so stuff could be saved instead always having a fresh start)
[2017/11/29, 21:30:42] Stuart Mesham: Oh why did you reinstall?
[2017/11/29, 21:31:20] Luc Hayward: It was acting up
[2017/11/29, 21:31:33] Luc Hayward: Decided to just clear it all up for the new year
[2017/11/29, 21:32:01] Luc Hayward: But it's gone back to remembering that I don't have an activated windows copy so not sure what I'll do to fix that, oh well isn't a huge deal
[2017/11/29, 21:44:53] Stuart Mesham: Right
[2017/11/29, 21:46:01] Stuart Mesham: The waterproof PC did that for a week and then it did an update and suddenly all was well again 🤷🏻‍♂
[2017/11/29, 21:47:32] Luc Hayward: 😂official title
[2017/11/29, 21:51:22] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😆
[2017/11/30, 13:20:43] Luc Hayward: I've lost your networking thing
[2017/11/30, 13:21:38] Luc Hayward: Oh it really is just called networking I thyought there were more??
[2017/11/30, 13:30:47] Luc Hayward: weird
[2017/11/30, 13:38:23] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I also thought there was another
[2017/11/30, 13:38:28] Stuart Mesham: Don't know where it went
[2017/11/30, 13:38:37] Luc Hayward: there is another but it doesn't do anything except say its broken
[2017/11/30, 13:47:52] Stuart Mesham: Ah you didn't try it on your PC 😂
[2017/11/30, 13:48:03] Luc Hayward: I did
[2017/11/30, 13:48:17] Stuart Mesham: It didn't work? 😂
[2017/11/30, 13:48:17] Luc Hayward: I read throught the code it literally just says "no cant do this
[2017/11/30, 13:48:25] Luc Hayward: the main one works
[2017/11/30, 13:48:31] Luc Hayward: but the other one i looked at doesnt
[2017/11/30, 13:48:38] Luc Hayward: you finished?
[2017/11/30, 13:48:39] Stuart Mesham: MessageClient3?
[2017/11/30, 13:48:55] Stuart Mesham: No, in _the waiting room_ dun dun duuuun
[2017/11/30, 13:48:56] Luc Hayward: yeah that's got nothing in it
[2017/11/30, 13:49:01] Luc Hayward: Networking works though
[2017/11/30, 13:49:13] Stuart Mesham: It's meant to shut down your PC 😂
[2017/11/30, 13:49:43] Stuart Mesham: Boyd and I sent it to Lloyd and asked him to test our messaging thing with us
[2017/11/30, 13:49:57] Stuart Mesham: And it worked beautifully
[2017/11/30, 13:50:01] Luc Hayward: It does nothing
[2017/11/30, 13:50:09] Stuart Mesham: Useless
[2017/11/30, 13:50:25] Stuart Mesham: Maybe they changed the shut down code in Windows 10
[2017/11/30, 13:50:46] Stuart Mesham: Lloyd was on Windows 8 when we did it I think
[2017/11/30, 13:51:01] Luc Hayward: oh
[2017/11/30, 13:51:07] Luc Hayward: I never even read that line
[2017/11/30, 13:51:09] Luc Hayward: that's nasty
[2017/11/30, 13:51:14] Luc Hayward: I ran it on mac
[2017/11/30, 13:51:52] Stuart Mesham: Useless!
[2017/11/30, 13:52:27] Luc Hayward: xD
[2017/11/30, 16:14:59] Luc Hayward: Freedom!
[2017/11/30, 16:28:17] Stuart Mesham: Yes!
[2017/11/30, 16:28:35] Luc Hayward: fuck yes
[2017/11/30, 16:28:57] Stuart Mesham: And fuck bio! 🙌🏻🎉
[2017/11/30, 16:29:17] Stuart Mesham: It's over 😂
[2017/11/30, 16:29:16] Luc Hayward: <‎GIF omitted>
[2017/11/30, 16:29:42] Stuart Mesham: Yes 👌🏻👌🏻😂
[2017/11/30, 16:42:04] Stuart Mesham: This feels amazing
[2017/12/01, 06:05:10] Luc Hayward: Did you see the alumni news?
[2017/12/01, 06:05:23] Luc Hayward: Mrs Davies and Mrs Williams passed away
[2017/12/01, 08:34:32] Stuart Mesham: I didn't
[2017/12/01, 08:35:47] Stuart Mesham: That's terrible
[2017/12/01, 08:37:05] Stuart Mesham: I saw Mrs Williams again in 2014
[2017/12/01, 18:24:59] Luc Hayward: ay
[2017/12/01, 18:25:00] Luc Hayward: so
[2017/12/01, 18:25:13] Luc Hayward: you aren't using chrome anymore right?
[2017/12/01, 18:25:19] Luc Hayward: and are you still using sublime?
[2017/12/01, 19:07:35] Stuart Mesham: Safari for the win
[2017/12/01, 19:07:55] Stuart Mesham: Technically but I haven't actually used it in ages
[2017/12/01, 19:08:14] Luc Hayward: right right
[2017/12/01, 19:08:18] Luc Hayward: ok cool was curious
[2017/12/01, 19:09:33] Stuart Mesham: Just in the vague hope that it might use less battery than chrome though 🙈
[2017/12/01, 19:11:58] Luc Hayward: 😂because battery is such an issue
[2017/12/01, 19:14:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I can't really rationalise my decision any further than that
[2017/12/01, 19:21:11] Luc Hayward: Literally only use safari if I NEED that extra batter else I just plug in
[2017/12/03, 10:03:24] Luc Hayward: I found out how to download and import full style guides into intellij
[2017/12/03, 13:10:09] Stuart Mesham: That's cool
[2017/12/03, 13:10:21] Stuart Mesham: How?
[2017/12/03, 13:14:06] Luc Hayward: Best way seems to be with a plugin for intellij
[2017/12/03, 13:14:26] Luc Hayward: They actually have lots of guides just google it
[2017/12/03, 13:15:20] Stuart Mesham: Oh so could you download the Google style guidelines?
[2017/12/03, 13:17:30] Stuart Mesham: Oh and the waterproof PC was still saying it wasn't genuine so I tried installing the windows 7 that I originally had on my laptop and then clicking the free upgrade to Windows 10 and it seems to have worked
[2017/12/03, 13:26:28] Luc Hayward: Yeah it probs would
[2017/12/03, 13:26:31] Luc Hayward: Yeah you could
[2017/12/03, 17:54:39] Luc Hayward: I'm going to shoot something
[2017/12/03, 18:10:40] Stuart Mesham: Hah, you don't have a gun
[2017/12/03, 18:16:09] Luc Hayward: Try me....
[2017/12/03, 18:16:27] Stuart Mesham: What's wrong? 😂
[2017/12/03, 18:16:42] Luc Hayward: I made the dumbest mistake in my code
[2017/12/03, 18:17:35] Luc Hayward: Duplicated a line in on of my server classes, went back and checked it in the textbook with a simple example ....... and I duplicated the same damn line so my server was just sitting there expecting two sets of input
[2017/12/03, 18:17:37] Luc Hayward: its ok
[2017/12/03, 18:17:40] Stuart Mesham: Wait wait on an unrelated note, if I just go straight down the M3 right until the end is it possible for me to mess up and get lost on the way to Tyger's?
[2017/12/03, 18:17:40] Luc Hayward: I was dumb
[2017/12/03, 18:17:43] Luc Hayward: I fixed it
[2017/12/03, 18:17:48] Luc Hayward: no
[2017/12/03, 18:17:53] Luc Hayward: go all the way to the end
[2017/12/03, 18:18:00] Luc Hayward: and then at the end of the highway go left
[2017/12/03, 18:18:06] Stuart Mesham: Oh damn 😂
[2017/12/03, 18:18:08] Luc Hayward: and go all the way down till the robots
[2017/12/03, 18:18:14] Luc Hayward: then take a right and just follow the road
[2017/12/03, 18:18:16] Luc Hayward: or ask google
[2017/12/03, 18:18:46] Stuart Mesham: I don't wanna ask Google because I'm too scared to look at my phone while on the highway
[2017/12/03, 18:19:33] Stuart Mesham: Is there a possibility that I might accidentally go straight here or is there a wall/building of sorts in the way?
[2017/12/03, 18:20:05] Luc Hayward: Big building
[2017/12/03, 18:20:18] Stuart Mesham: Ok thanks 😂
[2017/12/03, 18:20:20] Luc Hayward: And the end of the m3 goes off the edge of a hill if you go straight
[2017/12/03, 18:20:48] Stuart Mesham: Ok I hopefully won't mess up that badly
[2017/12/07, 19:13:10] Luc Hayward: Time to end the debate

[2017/12/09, 23:12:26] Luc Hayward: Bounce this around your head
[2017/12/09, 23:13:39] Luc Hayward: Would you just largely approximate the square root of the number, make that you're upset boundary and then just binary search through the remaining answers?
[2017/12/09, 23:21:41] Luc Hayward: Upper
[2017/12/09, 23:21:50] Luc Hayward: That should be fastest
[2017/12/09, 23:30:32] Luc Hayward: Although it might be faster to just dive right into a binary search. Worst case scenario is only like 23 comparisons
[2017/12/10, 00:49:00] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah if there's no sqrt function I'd just do this
[2017/12/10, 20:20:53] Luc Hayward: Message me when you get a chance, haven't had a chance to look over your messenger but wanted to ask you about the multitasking and see why you might have chosen a different way to mine
[2017/12/10, 20:40:11] Stuart Mesham: Hi
[2017/12/10, 21:21:19] Luc Hayward: So
[2017/12/10, 21:21:31] Luc Hayward: Multithreading
[2017/12/10, 21:21:40] Luc Hayward: Extend or implement
[2017/12/10, 22:04:32] Stuart Mesham: Afraid I can't remember at all
[2017/12/11, 16:47:37] Stuart Mesham: There's eduroam WiFi at all these universities
[2017/12/11, 16:59:58] Luc Hayward: does it work??
[2017/12/11, 17:01:20] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I was like "wait why is my phone on WiFi?"
[2017/12/11, 17:01:26] Luc Hayward: thats so nice
[2017/12/11, 17:01:38] Stuart Mesham: And now all of the universities I've been to have had it
[2017/12/11, 17:01:57] Stuart Mesham: It's great 😂

[2017/12/13, 14:01:24] Luc Hayward: Nick has more but we don't
[2017/12/13, 14:01:41] Stuart Mesham: Right

[2018/01/06, 14:49:44] Luc Hayward: Yep
[2018/01/06, 14:59:10] Stuart Mesham: When are you getting back from Knysna?
[2018/01/06, 15:00:15] Luc Hayward: Literally on the day we leave that's why my car is going to run late
[2018/01/06, 15:00:30] Stuart Mesham: Oh right
[2018/01/06, 15:00:50] Stuart Mesham: Really making the most of the holiday 😂
[2018/01/06, 15:01:15] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2018/01/06, 15:01:19] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2018/01/06, 15:04:13] Luc Hayward: I mean I've done nothing programming productive
[2018/01/06, 15:04:27] Luc Hayward: Wrote the start of that threaded chat server
[2018/01/06, 15:04:37] Luc Hayward: Havent touched anything since
[2018/01/06, 15:04:48] Luc Hayward: Started reading again
[2018/01/06, 15:04:56] Luc Hayward: More
[2018/01/06, 15:05:05] Stuart Mesham: Oh me neither
[2018/01/06, 15:05:14] Stuart Mesham: Reading books?!
[2018/01/06, 15:05:40] Luc Hayward: Literally got it to the point that the server accepts infinite connection and just parrots your message back at you and then stopped 😂
[2018/01/06, 15:06:16] Stuart Mesham: Oh didn't you like it or did you just get busy?
[2018/01/06, 15:06:36] Luc Hayward: No just got busy and never went back yet
[2018/01/06, 15:06:56] Luc Hayward: Going to go back to it, set it up properly eventually
[2018/01/06, 15:07:10] Stuart Mesham: Yeah eventually 😂
[2018/01/06, 15:07:34] Stuart Mesham: I also haven't done anything code-y for more than a month
[2018/01/06, 15:07:58] Stuart Mesham: Also - gonna get back to it eventually
[2018/01/06, 15:08:19] Luc Hayward: Anything planned?
[2018/01/06, 15:08:25] Luc Hayward: Should start something togu
[2018/01/06, 15:08:29] Luc Hayward: Together
[2018/01/06, 15:09:18] Stuart Mesham: I reckon there'll be quite a long time when all the non-uni-students are back at work/school that we'll be sitting around trying to entertain ourselves so I'll start doing stuff then
[2018/01/06, 15:09:28] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that would be cool
[2018/01/06, 15:09:32] Luc Hayward: Yeah true true
[2018/01/06, 15:09:40] Stuart Mesham: We could make a chat thing
[2018/01/06, 15:09:48] Luc Hayward: Actually that would be super cool
[2018/01/06, 15:09:55] Stuart Mesham: A server and then android/ios clients
[2018/01/06, 15:10:06] Luc Hayward: I'd be keen
[2018/01/06, 15:10:08] Stuart Mesham: And maybe a desktop one just 'cause
[2018/01/06, 15:10:20] Luc Hayward: Probably best to start with a desktop one
[2018/01/06, 15:10:27] Stuart Mesham: Yeah also keen
[2018/01/06, 15:10:36] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it'd probably be the easiest
[2018/01/06, 15:10:36] Luc Hayward: Or not a desktop client but a command line client because like....That's how we start
[2018/01/06, 15:10:51] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 😂
[2018/01/06, 15:10:57] Stuart Mesham: Baby steps
[2018/01/06, 15:11:20] Stuart Mesham: Big steps usually end in tears 😆
[2018/01/06, 15:11:42] Luc Hayward: Will make sure mine is written up similarly to your in terms of features and then I'll see what the differences are, yours is a chatroom right?
[2018/01/06, 15:11:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/01/06, 15:12:01] Luc Hayward: Plus gui
[2018/01/06, 15:12:14] Stuart Mesham: Yeah mine had a swing gui
[2018/01/06, 15:12:22] Luc Hayward: Ye I know
[2018/01/06, 15:13:24] Stuart Mesham: We may be able to host the chat thing on the downstairs TV/downloading PC at my house
[2018/01/06, 15:13:51] Stuart Mesham: Unless UCT has a really nice and easy to use server for us 😂
[2018/01/06, 15:13:53] Luc Hayward: Yeah or else arduino is like 150 bucks
[2018/01/06, 15:14:00] Luc Hayward: Else I'll look into aws
[2018/01/06, 15:14:05] Stuart Mesham: I have an arduino!
[2018/01/06, 15:14:10] Stuart Mesham: And a pi!
[2018/01/06, 15:14:21] Luc Hayward: Really? Why is nothing running on them
[2018/01/06, 15:14:27] Luc Hayward: Or being used for anything 😂😂
[2018/01/06, 15:14:50] Stuart Mesham: I just haven't gotten around to doing anything in a while
[2018/01/06, 15:15:06] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2018/01/06, 15:15:13] Luc Hayward: What sensors have you got?
[2018/01/06, 15:15:27] Stuart Mesham: I once made my bedside light remote controllable from a web interface but that's the only thing I've ever really done with the pi
[2018/01/06, 15:15:33] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2018/01/06, 15:16:02] Stuart Mesham: I've got an IR sensor salvaged from a toy RC helicopter thing
[2018/01/06, 15:16:24] Stuart Mesham: I got my bedside light to also work using a TV remote with that 😂
[2018/01/06, 15:16:42] Luc Hayward: Niiiiice
[2018/01/06, 15:16:43] Stuart Mesham: And some relay switches
[2018/01/06, 15:17:07] Stuart Mesham: And a whole bunch of random electrical components that I never use
[2018/01/06, 15:17:51] Luc Hayward: Hmmm I dno
[2018/01/06, 15:18:06] Luc Hayward: Did you see the solar panel used as a camera sensor I sent you?
[2018/01/06, 15:18:17] Stuart Mesham: So yeah one day when I'm really talented and have lots of time I'll make my house automatic 🤔
[2018/01/06, 15:18:21] Stuart Mesham: One day...
[2018/01/06, 15:18:29] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that was cool
[2018/01/06, 15:18:30] Luc Hayward: One day....
[2018/01/06, 15:18:35] Luc Hayward: Yeah it was super cool
[2018/01/06, 15:18:38] Stuart Mesham: I've got a tiny solar panel too
[2018/01/06, 15:18:44] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/01/06, 15:18:58] Luc Hayward: What I don't understand is why can't IR sensors be used to sense temperature ....
[2018/01/06, 15:20:05] Stuart Mesham: It's one specially designed to filter out IR that doesn't come from remotes etc.
[2018/01/06, 15:20:14] Luc Hayward: Ah ok makes sense
[2018/01/06, 15:20:21] Luc Hayward: Winder how that works
[2018/01/06, 15:20:33] Luc Hayward: Maybe it's very low in the IR spectrum
[2018/01/06, 15:20:55] Stuart Mesham: The remotes flash at a certain frequency and an onboard chip or something in the sensor only switches on when it detects IR flashing at that frequency I think
[2018/01/06, 15:21:24] Stuart Mesham: So sunlight would just be constantly on
[2018/01/06, 15:21:38] Stuart Mesham: So it wouldn't set off the IR sensor
[2018/01/06, 15:21:43] Luc Hayward: Oh that's super cool
[2018/01/06, 15:22:03] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 👌🏻
[2018/01/06, 15:23:56] Luc Hayward: Makes lots of sense
[2018/01/06, 15:24:12] Luc Hayward: Also means that you can just look for the peaks above the background radiation
[2018/01/06, 15:24:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/01/06, 15:25:12] Stuart Mesham: Fun fact for the day - how remotes work
[2018/01/06, 15:25:19] Luc Hayward: Yeah!!!
[2018/01/06, 15:25:19] Stuart Mesham: I thought that was pretty cool
[2018/01/06, 15:25:31] Luc Hayward: Other fun fact for the day, there's still no 2018 handbooks
[2018/01/06, 15:25:46] Stuart Mesham: I was also looking! 😂
[2018/01/06, 15:25:55] Luc Hayward: Third fun fact for the day which is always going to be fun, we get access to the senior labs! Well sorta senior
[2018/01/06, 15:26:12] Stuart Mesham: The ones where we had the competition?
[2018/01/06, 15:28:36] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2018/01/06, 15:29:11] Luc Hayward: Access protected by our cards
[2018/01/06, 15:29:18] Stuart Mesham: Yesss ✊🏻😂
[2018/01/06, 15:29:20] Luc Hayward: More powerful of I think too
[2018/01/06, 15:29:39] Stuart Mesham: Yeesssss
[2018/01/06, 15:29:58] Luc Hayward: Plug points
[2018/01/06, 15:30:01] Stuart Mesham: It's gonna become the new MLC
[2018/01/06, 15:30:01] Luc Hayward: Less sticky
[2018/01/06, 15:30:04] Luc Hayward: Less smelly
[2018/01/06, 15:30:15] Stuart Mesham: That's a big one 😂
[2018/01/06, 15:30:27] Stuart Mesham: Gonna do all my work there
[2018/01/06, 15:30:28] Luc Hayward: Yeah but another good thing is minimal talking (although maybe that's different during the term time)
[2018/01/06, 15:31:01] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I reckon it's normally quite quiet
[2018/01/06, 15:37:37] Luc Hayward: Do you think so?
[2018/01/06, 15:38:17] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/01/06, 15:38:29] Luc Hayward: I thought it probably got quite loud
[2018/01/06, 15:38:37] Luc Hayward: And busy
[2018/01/06, 15:38:42] Stuart Mesham: Unless the second years all have a group project
[2018/01/06, 15:39:05] Luc Hayward: Have you heard about all the security flaws coming to light in CPU?
[2018/01/06, 15:39:06] Stuart Mesham: Then it probably gets loud

[2018/01/07, 16:16:42] Stuart Mesham: Will have a look at this in a bit
[2018/01/07, 17:33:44] Luc Hayward: Google his patreon page
[2018/01/07, 17:33:57] Luc Hayward: Didnt read it myself
[2018/01/07, 17:46:03] Stuart Mesham: I didn't know you could make this much from YouTube
[2018/01/07, 17:55:17] Luc Hayward: mate
[2018/01/07, 17:55:23] Luc Hayward: thats note even that much
[2018/01/07, 17:55:31] Luc Hayward: look into some of your favourites on patreon
[2018/01/07, 18:04:48] Luc Hayward: lol borrowed my dads two 23" monitors and hooked them to the mac so now I have my laptop and two big creens
[2018/01/07, 21:48:03] Luc Hayward: Send a picture tomorrow it's a fantastic setup
[2018/01/07, 21:53:41] Luc Hayward: Can have everything you want open and in reach
[2018/01/07, 22:23:23] Luc Hayward: LED cube

[2018/01/08, 00:01:49] Stuart Mesham: That's so cool! 😱
[2018/01/08, 12:42:23] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/08, 13:49:20] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2018/01/08, 16:11:35] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/08, 16:16:06] Stuart Mesham: There's another one called Hello Internet that I've listened to quite a lot of
[2018/01/08, 16:16:31] Stuart Mesham: It's him and the guy who does numberphile
[2018/01/08, 16:21:02] Luc Hayward: ye saw that too
[2018/01/08, 16:21:43] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/08, 16:22:58] Stuart Mesham: Why
[2018/01/08, 16:23:10] Stuart Mesham: ...do you still have jGrasp?
[2018/01/08, 16:23:34] Luc Hayward: juist looking at the different idioms that get used
[2018/01/08, 16:24:11] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2018/01/08, 16:24:17] Stuart Mesham: Just checked
[2018/01/08, 16:24:19] Luc Hayward: like implementing runnable vs extending thread; synchronized methods vs synchronized statements vs atomic access
[2018/01/08, 16:24:21] Stuart Mesham: I still have it too
[2018/01/08, 16:24:37] Luc Hayward: and because its nice to have something simple when you need it
[2018/01/08, 16:25:04] Stuart Mesham: Eh
[2018/01/08, 16:25:13] Stuart Mesham: Shmeh
[2018/01/08, 16:25:49] Luc Hayward: like when doing varsity assignments, if you need to debug with a debugger although I suppose if you're at the stage that you need a debugger you should just move to something more powerful anyway
[2018/01/08, 16:25:54] Luc Hayward: will probably delete it
[2018/01/08, 16:26:02] Luc Hayward: can compile and run small things via the command line
[2018/01/08, 16:26:09] Luc Hayward: terminal on mac***
[2018/01/08, 16:26:48] Stuart Mesham: I just have lots of clutter-y projects with a whole lot of random test stuff in them
[2018/01/08, 16:27:10] Luc Hayward: ew
[2018/01/08, 16:27:18] Luc Hayward: clean up your project folders
[2018/01/08, 16:27:19] Stuart Mesham: I know
[2018/01/08, 16:27:36] Stuart Mesham: I can't deal with 0 autocomplete though
[2018/01/08, 16:30:04] Luc Hayward: do you think you could rewrite the shutdown project for unix/mac?
[2018/01/08, 16:30:22] Luc Hayward: tell someone it needs a password and have it run sudo rm -rf
[2018/01/08, 16:27:50] Stuart Mesham: One day
[2018/01/08, 16:31:29] Luc Hayward: Try run that? I’ll give you 20 bucks to type your password for it
[2018/01/08, 16:32:03] Stuart Mesham: Who you gonna give that to? 😂
[2018/01/08, 16:32:20] Luc Hayward: 😂 Try run it?
[2018/01/08, 16:33:06] Stuart Mesham: Waaaait a minute
[2018/01/08, 16:33:21] Stuart Mesham: That's not a shutdown one
[2018/01/08, 16:33:51] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2018/01/08, 16:33:50] Stuart Mesham: That's a set-your-laptop-on-fire or something one, isn't it?
[2018/01/08, 16:34:17] Luc Hayward: sudo (admin privileges) rm (remove) -rf(forced recursive)
[2018/01/08, 16:34:41] Luc Hayward: I think what its meant to do is recursively remove every file contained within the working directory
[2018/01/08, 16:34:53] Stuart Mesham: Oh delete everything
[2018/01/08, 16:34:59] Stuart Mesham: Awesome 😂
[2018/01/08, 16:36:41] Luc Hayward: yep
[2018/01/08, 16:36:44] Luc Hayward: haha
[2018/01/08, 16:37:27] Luc Hayward: non recoverable delete, using terminal to delete things bypasses the recycle bin so the only way to get it back would be to somehow remark those sectors of the disk as not-empty
[2018/01/08, 16:40:46] Stuart Mesham: Yeah if I was less lazy I might have just done that to my laptop
[2018/01/08, 16:41:53] Luc Hayward: 😂😂😂😂
[2018/01/08, 16:42:01] Luc Hayward: I don't actually know what it will do on mac
[2018/01/08, 16:42:17] Luc Hayward: I know on the really free versions of linux it will totally destroy your day
[2018/01/08, 16:42:29] Luc Hayward: but macOS might be kind enough to prevent any real damage
[2018/01/08, 16:42:49] Stuart Mesham: Well I'm not gonna test it 😂
[2018/01/08, 16:43:31] Luc Hayward: apparently its noticeably faster if you're looking to remove thousands of files at once
[2018/01/08, 16:45:37] Stuart Mesham: So _this_ is what those "speed up your Mac" programs do...
[2018/01/08, 16:46:51] Luc Hayward: 😂nah those go and remove all the clutter and extra files people have
[2018/01/08, 16:47:38] Luc Hayward: Do we have a prescribed Textbook next year
[2018/01/08, 17:07:51] Stuart Mesham: Not sure
[2018/01/08, 17:08:21] Stuart Mesham: I guess they'll only start making Vula announcements after uni starts
[2018/01/08, 17:46:08] Luc Hayward: probably
[2018/01/08, 17:46:14] Luc Hayward: thought you might have heard from friends
[2018/01/08, 18:04:52] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2018/01/08, 18:42:09] Luc Hayward: Are you planning to do what you did last year and read up on our topics in advance?
[2018/01/08, 20:10:30] Stuart Mesham: I don't think I did that last year 😂
[2018/01/08, 20:10:46] Stuart Mesham: We just went "oh we're doing Python"
[2018/01/08, 20:11:28] Luc Hayward: For Java not for python python was piss. Although actually no I did go through one of those online refreshers on the python syntax because I'd never used it
[2018/01/08, 20:15:02] Stuart Mesham: Oh yeah
[2018/01/08, 20:15:14] Stuart Mesham: I might do that a bit later in the holiday
[2018/01/08, 20:15:37] Luc Hayward: If you do just make a reading list of the best stuff for me? Will do the same for you
[2018/01/08, 20:42:21] Stuart Mesham: Sure 👍🏻
[2018/01/08, 20:43:41] Luc Hayward: Have some stuff to add to it (though I still need to read then so they might not be worthwhile) on multithreading in Java. Two write-ups written after java8
[2018/01/08, 20:49:47] Stuart Mesham: Oh thanks
[2018/01/08, 20:50:18] Stuart Mesham: Might read up tomorrow
[2018/01/09, 09:50:01] Stuart Mesham: <‎video omitted>
[2018/01/09, 09:50:28] Stuart Mesham: <‎video omitted>
[2018/01/09, 09:51:17] Stuart Mesham: This game is so good 😂
[2018/01/09, 10:07:04] Luc Hayward: Why no screen recording software😂
[2018/01/09, 10:07:56] Luc Hayward: What game
[2018/01/09, 10:11:21] Stuart Mesham: I am not that competent
[2018/01/09, 10:11:59] Stuart Mesham: It's called Brick Rigs
[2018/01/09, 10:12:25] Stuart Mesham: Best semi-blind torrent I ever downloaded 👌🏻😂
[2018/01/09, 10:12:25] Luc Hayward: Download obs or something and screen record instead😂😂
[2018/01/09, 10:12:32] Stuart Mesham: Impulse download
[2018/01/09, 10:12:36] Luc Hayward: Your degree says you are
[2018/01/09, 10:12:45] Luc Hayward: Is it worth it?
[2018/01/09, 10:13:11] Stuart Mesham: I mean it's computer science I guess I should be able to screen record 😂
[2018/01/09, 10:13:25] Luc Hayward: Yep😂😂
[2018/01/09, 10:13:33] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 💯
[2018/01/09, 10:13:38] Luc Hayward: Wow a screen recorder in binary
[2018/01/09, 10:13:42] Luc Hayward: Write*
[2018/01/09, 10:13:43] Stuart Mesham: For about half an hour
[2018/01/09, 10:14:07] Stuart Mesham: Nah bru that's what we'll do in honours
[2018/01/09, 10:17:00] Luc Hayward: 😂
[2018/01/09, 10:17:23] Luc Hayward: Google github dev setup
[2018/01/09, 10:17:36] Luc Hayward: There are automated tools to setup your dev environment
[2018/01/09, 10:18:35] Stuart Mesham: Hm interesting
[2018/01/09, 10:19:07] Luc Hayward: Using homebrew
[2018/01/09, 10:19:12] Luc Hayward: Google it it's super cool
[2018/01/09, 10:20:55] Stuart Mesham: That is super cool
[2018/01/09, 10:21:11] Stuart Mesham: Does it download your IDEs as well?
[2018/01/09, 10:22:29] Luc Hayward: Yeah Google it
[2018/01/09, 10:22:38] Luc Hayward: Literally just search dev setup on github
[2018/01/09, 10:22:53] Stuart Mesham: I did but it's a lot of reading
[2018/01/09, 10:23:33] Luc Hayward: https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup
[2018/01/09, 10:23:49] Luc Hayward: https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup
[2018/01/09, 10:23:52] Luc Hayward: Here check these
[2018/01/09, 10:25:48] Stuart Mesham: This one's just instructions on how to manually install stuff
[2018/01/09, 10:39:52] Luc Hayward: Ah ok
[2018/01/09, 12:12:19] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/BBFtblr3_6Y

[2018/01/09, 20:21:55] Stuart Mesham: Why?
[2018/01/09, 20:22:08] Stuart Mesham: I don't get it
[2018/01/09, 20:23:19] Luc Hayward: Sudo means requires password
[2018/01/09, 20:24:46] Stuart Mesham: Oh right
[2018/01/10, 13:00:57] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/jJKU9f7A-EY 
Looks cool
[2018/01/10, 16:24:14] Luc Hayward: Still no hand book.....
[2018/01/11, 00:32:05] Stuart Mesham: Still...
[2018/01/11, 09:40:06] Stuart Mesham: Is that a man bun or did you cut your hair?
[2018/01/11, 09:40:45] Luc Hayward: Bun
[2018/01/11, 09:41:05] Stuart Mesham: Oh of course
[2018/01/11, 09:41:54] Stuart Mesham: In comp sci, people will think you're a 3rd year already
[2018/01/11, 09:51:54] Luc Hayward: 😂😂 best I get good
[2018/01/11, 09:52:35] Luc Hayward: If I look like a third year I don't want to be the shitty third year 😂
[2018/01/11, 09:52:58] Luc Hayward: Finished reading the concurrent stuff in Java, starts to get a bit brainfucky
[2018/01/11, 10:26:49] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2018/01/11, 10:27:17] Stuart Mesham: Gonna read this after the camping probably 👍🏻
[2018/01/11, 10:27:42] Stuart Mesham: Did you read it from the Java textbook?
[2018/01/11, 13:30:37] Luc Hayward: Nah that was easy that's all low level stuff. It's the higher level libraries that are weird
[2018/01/11, 13:33:29] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2018/01/11, 17:16:52] Stuart Mesham: You on WiFi?
[2018/01/11, 17:22:22] Stuart Mesham: Nvm
[2018/01/11, 21:24:50] Luc Hayward: Nah soz 😂 you get sorted though?
[2018/01/11, 21:32:49] Stuart Mesham: Ye
[2018/01/11, 21:33:01] Luc Hayward: Sick
[2018/01/11, 21:35:33] Stuart Mesham: Ugh bad omens
[2018/01/11, 21:35:50] Stuart Mesham: I got a nosebleed
[2018/01/11, 21:35:52] Luc Hayward: Why
[2018/01/11, 21:35:55] Luc Hayward: Ohhhh
[2018/01/11, 21:35:58] Luc Hayward: This is bad
[2018/01/11, 21:36:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah and I haven't had one in months
[2018/01/11, 21:36:40] Stuart Mesham: Pray for me please
[2018/01/11, 21:36:45] Luc Hayward: I'm sure you'll be fine...Maybe this is your only one for the next three
[2018/01/11, 21:37:10] Stuart Mesham: I really wish it worked like that 😂
[2018/01/11, 21:37:18] Luc Hayward: I did stats trust me
[2018/01/11, 21:37:24] Stuart Mesham: 😂😂
[2018/01/11, 21:37:42] Luc Hayward: I got 72 or 73 or something means I must be right
[2018/01/11, 21:38:04] Stuart Mesham: Well hearing it from a professional is reassuring
[2018/01/11, 21:39:22] Luc Hayward: Exactly
[2018/01/11, 21:39:24] Luc Hayward: 😂😂
[2018/01/11, 21:39:41] Luc Hayward: I'm right 10% of the time, 100% of the time
[2018/01/11, 21:39:57] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2018/01/11, 21:40:17] Stuart Mesham: That must be the best one I've heard
[2018/01/11, 21:42:39] Luc Hayward: I think it's meant to be the other way around 😂
[2018/01/11, 21:44:34] Stuart Mesham: Would sound more impressive
[2018/01/11, 21:45:16] Luc Hayward: Anywho, cheers man, need to catch an early night. Up at 6 to get to George for my flight on time tomorrow
[2018/01/11, 21:45:47] Stuart Mesham: Cheers, see you tomorrow 👍🏻
[2018/01/14, 20:36:02] Luc Hayward: http://store.steampowered.com/app/690040/SUPERHOT_MIND_CONTROL_DELETE/
[2018/01/15, 10:50:30] Stuart Mesham: Yaaaay! 😄
[2018/01/15, 10:50:38] Stuart Mesham: 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
[2018/01/15, 12:00:21] Luc Hayward: I have you cleaning cloth, will give it back next time I see you
[2018/01/15, 12:28:18] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2018/01/15, 18:11:01] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/15, 18:26:54] Luc Hayward: Holy shit they made the maths requirements for comp sci a joke compared to mam1000
[2018/01/15, 19:07:28] Luc Hayward: ay do you know what morris and jeremy are majoring in out of interest? I know Jeremy is doing a triple major in comp sci, maths and something else I think......
[2018/01/15, 22:52:30] Stuart Mesham: There are so few words I understand in there
[2018/01/15, 22:53:33] Stuart Mesham: Last I heard, Morris was thinking about doing a similar thing. I do know that he's definitely doing a maths major though
[2018/01/16, 09:22:16] Luc Hayward: I understood best paper award
[2018/01/16, 09:22:23] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2018/01/16, 09:22:28] Luc Hayward: hmm ok
[2018/01/16, 11:23:59] Stuart Mesham: Wait actually I know what Morris is doing: Comp Sci, game dev and maths
[2018/01/16, 11:24:12] Stuart Mesham: Don't know about Jeremy though
[2018/01/16, 11:50:22] Luc Hayward: right
[2018/01/16, 11:51:15] Luc Hayward: cus basically I was doing game dev but now I'm wondering whether it's safe to continue because they're dropping the course after next year(ie I would be the final year it was offered to) and I don't want to do something that the varsity has stopped caring about...
[2018/01/16, 12:18:53] Stuart Mesham: Yeah that's true
[2018/01/16, 12:19:19] Stuart Mesham: Ask Morris how good/bad the second year game dev courses were though
[2018/01/16, 12:19:45] Stuart Mesham: Because if they're good now they'll probably stay good for the next 2 years
[2018/01/16, 12:20:12] Luc Hayward: so the second year course is being dropped as soon as this year are finished with it
[2018/01/16, 12:20:43] Stuart Mesham: Yeah no I get that 😄
[2018/01/16, 12:20:50] Luc Hayward: 😂👍
[2018/01/16, 12:20:56] Stuart Mesham: You'll just get their last lectures ever
[2018/01/16, 12:21:33] Stuart Mesham: Maybe the only reason is that not enough people do game dev
[2018/01/16, 12:21:45] Luc Hayward: perhaps, I'm emailing them about it now
[2018/01/16, 12:22:52] Stuart Mesham: In which case it could still be those lecturers' pride and joy and they'll give you good lectures/assignments 😄
[2018/01/16, 12:23:53] Luc Hayward: hmmm possibly, was more concerned that it would end up being a case of "This is the last time I'm teaching this so there's no need to look at the future and ensure that the course is relevant"
[2018/01/16, 12:26:13] Stuart Mesham: I'll ask Morris
[2018/01/16, 12:33:44] Luc Hayward: thanks, just got this response from the guy that takes the third year games and C++ courses
[2018/01/16, 12:33:45] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/16, 12:34:51] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/16, 12:37:09] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2018/01/16, 12:37:31] Stuart Mesham: But yeah so it sounds like it's probably still good
[2018/01/16, 12:38:36] Stuart Mesham: Maybe they just had to get rid of it to make fees fall a bit
[2018/01/16, 12:41:33] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2018/01/16, 18:53:00] Luc Hayward: Ask them if they're taking three or 4 courses each semster this year?
[2018/01/16, 20:59:09] Stuart Mesham: When they reply...
[2018/01/16, 20:59:22] Luc Hayward: 😂👍
[2018/01/17, 07:08:10] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/17, 07:09:55] Stuart Mesham: Maybe _after_ I make lots and lots of money I'll get one 👍🏻
[2018/01/17, 07:16:29] Luc Hayward: Wish up so early
[2018/01/17, 07:16:31] Luc Hayward: Woah
[2018/01/17, 07:26:21] Stuart Mesham: * shock and amazement * 😄
[2018/01/17, 07:28:16] Luc Hayward: But why
[2018/01/17, 07:33:35] Stuart Mesham: I dunno, I just woke up at 6 because it got light 🤷🏻‍♂
[2018/01/17, 07:34:00] Luc Hayward: Get block out on your curtains
[2018/01/17, 07:36:28] Stuart Mesham: I know, I should do thay
[2018/01/17, 07:36:57] Stuart Mesham: Are you also looking at all the missile warning systems on programmerhumour? 😄
[2018/01/17, 07:51:52] Luc Hayward: not really, what are they about

[2018/01/21, 19:51:51] Luc Hayward: Is it really😂
[2018/01/21, 19:52:08] Stuart Mesham: It is indeed 😂
[2018/01/21, 19:52:22] Luc Hayward: No it's not in the drop down. You type it into one of the free spots in first semester
[2018/01/21, 19:52:43] Luc Hayward: 2019 column is for your intended third year courses
[2018/01/21, 19:52:51] Stuart Mesham: Did you use preview? I can't type stuff
[2018/01/21, 19:53:45] Luc Hayward: No open it in chrome

[2018/01/21, 20:08:11] Luc Hayward: You should just throw your courses in (not in any particular order
[2018/01/21, 20:11:02] Stuart Mesham: Right and I'm guessing I don't have to mention STA1000S anywhere?
[2018/01/21, 20:11:44] Stuart Mesham: Actually I'll just put it in the 6-10 slot just in case
[2018/01/21, 20:12:09] Luc Hayward: You do
[2018/01/21, 20:12:24] Luc Hayward: Anything you don't mention, you don't register for

[2018/01/21, 21:53:34] Luc Hayward: Screenshot me before you send it 👍
[2018/01/21, 21:54:49] Stuart Mesham: I'm putting it on hold for a while though because I'm gonna email the UCT-provided student advisor about that INF2009 clash
[2018/01/21, 21:55:03] Luc Hayward: Yeah do that
[2018/01/21, 21:55:06] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2018/01/21, 21:55:07] Luc Hayward: Uhm
[2018/01/21, 21:55:15] Luc Hayward: You can take it in first semester of third year
[2018/01/21, 21:55:36] Luc Hayward: Just double check that but I'm fairly certain because that's what I got told about computer engineering
[2018/01/21, 21:55:36] Stuart Mesham: Oh no I don't want to do that
[2018/01/21, 21:56:08] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/21, 21:56:04] Stuart Mesham: I'd much rather lecture video it out this year if it's an option 😄

[2018/01/21, 21:57:00] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'll email Sonia

[2018/01/23, 16:21:44] Stuart Mesham: Oh there's also a web page
[2018/01/23, 16:22:20] Luc Hayward: oh ew I see that
[2018/01/23, 16:23:00] Luc Hayward: Have you read 2006
[2018/01/23, 16:23:09] Stuart Mesham: No?
[2018/01/23, 16:23:18] Luc Hayward: check that as wel
[2018/01/23, 16:23:22] Luc Hayward: inbf2006f
[2018/01/23, 16:23:30] Luc Hayward: That's the mini one I'm taking
[2018/01/23, 16:23:33] Stuart Mesham: In the handbook or webpage?
[2018/01/23, 16:23:57] Luc Hayward: either
[2018/01/23, 16:24:08] Luc Hayward: read webpage it seems to say the same and then extra compared to handbook
[2018/01/23, 16:25:25] Stuart Mesham: That sounds like more work than the 2009 one but maybe a bit more useful
[2018/01/23, 16:26:15] Luc Hayward: seemed interresting asnd very useful
[2018/01/23, 16:26:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'm wondering what they tell you about warehousing 🤔
[2018/01/23, 16:30:08] Luc Hayward: no clue
[2018/01/23, 16:30:19] Luc Hayward: you playerd binding of isaac right?
[2018/01/23, 16:33:40] Stuart Mesham: I didn't but I saw people playing it a lot
[2018/01/23, 16:34:52] Luc Hayward: should try it
[2018/01/23, 17:19:08] Stuart Mesham: One day...
[2018/01/23, 17:19:23] Luc Hayward: do ittttt
[2018/01/23, 17:19:25] Stuart Mesham: Maybe very soon 😂
[2018/01/23, 17:20:01] Luc Hayward: ok so I can't do that course we spoke about at lunch because it has too much clashes and isn't key to my major so they basically just won't approve the concession
[2018/01/23, 17:20:05] Stuart Mesham: Jono is starting a vlog for next year's MAM1000W students
[2018/01/23, 17:20:11] Luc Hayward: I saw
[2018/01/23, 17:20:57] Stuart Mesham: Wait did you ask Hussein for a concession over email?
[2018/01/23, 17:21:10] Luc Hayward: Spoke to sonia
[2018/01/23, 17:22:05] Stuart Mesham: She tells me I have to print out and fill in the concession form and take it to Hussein's office on 12/13 Feb to find out!
[2018/01/23, 17:22:27] Luc Hayward: then read the guidelines on applying for concessions and it said that if it has more than one clash day or isn't required for my degree they usually won't let me take both at the same time (Sonia said I do have to take it, you're allowed to potentially skip because you have enough credits without ing2009f)
[2018/01/23, 17:22:34] Stuart Mesham: The registration deadlines will probably have come and gone by then!
[2018/01/23, 17:22:55] Luc Hayward: Nah it should be fine
[2018/01/23, 17:22:58] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2018/01/23, 17:23:04] Luc Hayward: first years don't register till after that
[2018/01/23, 17:24:01] Luc Hayward: So I'm thinking linguistics sounds like it might potentially be work....so maybe I will actually take a philosophy course and just regurgitate essays (similar to how I bullshitted our ethics essay and did so well considering i wrote less than 400 words)
[2018/01/23, 17:23:17] Stuart Mesham: Right
[2018/01/23, 17:24:15] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/23, 17:24:28] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/23, 17:24:30] Luc Hayward: one of those
[2018/01/23, 17:24:41] Stuart Mesham: Oh my word no
[2018/01/23, 17:25:09] Luc Hayward: tyger did first year ethics (which was like the same content as ours) and said it was piss easy but kinda boring. But this one doesnt assume any previous ethics knowledge so I'm hoping its just simple shit
[2018/01/23, 17:24:59] Stuart Mesham: The first sentence gives this course an instant nope
[2018/01/23, 17:25:33] Luc Hayward: Yeah I'm leaning into ethics applied
[2018/01/23, 17:26:18] Stuart Mesham: Yuck 😂
[2018/01/23, 17:26:51] Stuart Mesham: Your options look so unfortunate
[2018/01/23, 17:27:52] Luc Hayward: It looks like it could be really easy like just provide well structured formalised arguments
[2018/01/23, 17:28:55] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/01/23, 17:29:00] Stuart Mesham: Shame man 😄
[2018/01/23, 17:29:56] Luc Hayward: I dno
[2018/01/23, 17:29:58] Luc Hayward: It's one semester
[2018/01/23, 17:30:01] Luc Hayward: just gotta pass
[2018/01/23, 17:30:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/01/24, 06:18:54] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/24, 09:58:45] Luc Hayward: 🕔?
[2018/01/24, 10:01:24] Stuart Mesham: Chris only wakes up at 2
[2018/01/24, 10:05:36] Luc Hayward: Lol
[2018/01/24, 10:12:06] Luc Hayward: Actually?
[2018/01/24, 10:30:30] Stuart Mesham: Yeah actually
[2018/01/24, 10:30:59] Luc Hayward: That's insane
[2018/01/24, 10:31:37] Stuart Mesham: Yeah idk how he survives like that 🤦🏻‍♂
[2018/01/24, 10:31:43] Luc Hayward: That's so weird
[2018/01/24, 10:32:08] Stuart Mesham: Probably not too healthy 😂
[2018/01/24, 10:39:20] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/24, 11:27:58] Luc Hayward: It probably is🤷🏻‍♂️ask sonia
[2018/01/24, 11:45:53] Stuart Mesham: Sonia I think I just sent Sonia too many questions in one email so she just noped out of all of them
[2018/01/24, 11:46:34] Luc Hayward: 😂woops
[2018/01/24, 11:47:53] Luc Hayward: Are you thinking to go early to Chris?
[2018/01/24, 11:48:34] Luc Hayward: 👌🏻
[2018/01/24, 11:48:56] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2018/01/24, 11:50:11] Stuart Mesham: Nah
[2018/01/24, 11:50:34] Luc Hayward: She basically just means don't put it on now, just apply without it and then later you can try for concessions
[2018/01/24, 11:50:39] Luc Hayward: what time then?
[2018/01/24, 11:51:09] Stuart Mesham: This could go terribly wrong though
[2018/01/24, 11:51:36] Stuart Mesham: I think I'll only actually go at 5
[2018/01/24, 11:53:38] Luc Hayward: Well apply for concession now too?
[2018/01/24, 11:53:47] Luc Hayward: Ok...bringing a mattress?
[2018/01/24, 12:02:00] Stuart Mesham: Yeah the registration/concession system is retarded. I'm just gonna not register for INF and then if next month, Hussein tells me I have to do the INF course, they'll allow me to register late for it if I scream and cry enough
[2018/01/24, 12:02:11] Stuart Mesham: I'll bring one
[2018/01/24, 12:05:15] Luc Hayward: Well techinically it's only needed next year second semester
[2018/01/24, 12:10:30] Stuart Mesham: Yeah but I'm pretty sure Hussein will make me do compensation work instead of inf and I want that to be sorted out this year
[2018/01/24, 12:15:35] Stuart Mesham: I'm gonna find out from one of Dan's friends who majored in comp sci + genetics last year what he did
[2018/01/24, 12:15:50] Stuart Mesham: Give up on Sonia
[2018/01/24, 12:15:55] Stuart Mesham: She's useless
[2018/01/24, 12:16:03] Luc Hayward: Right right
[2018/01/24, 12:20:00] Luc Hayward: thats a good plan to chat to dan's friend
[2018/01/24, 12:49:04] Stuart Mesham: Oh dear, he says no online registration for me
[2018/01/24, 12:57:45] Stuart Mesham: Ok if you want, you can actually show up earlier at my house 👍🏻
[2018/01/24, 13:01:18] Luc Hayward: Rip you
[2018/01/24, 13:01:26] Luc Hayward: At you? aren't we going to chris?
[2018/01/24, 13:01:51] Stuart Mesham: Yeah cancel that message
[2018/01/24, 13:02:00] Stuart Mesham: I was confused
[2018/01/24, 13:03:18] Stuart Mesham: I thought you had sent that message (which is on the group) to me on this chat so that made me think you wanted to come here first 🤦🏻‍♂
[2018/01/24, 13:03:27] Stuart Mesham: I figured it out now
[2018/01/24, 13:04:45] Stuart Mesham: How portable is your desktop pc? 😄
[2018/01/24, 13:05:03] Luc Hayward: ah ok, when you planning to go to chris?
[2018/01/24, 13:07:56] Luc Hayward: not very
[2018/01/24, 13:08:02] Luc Hayward: ahhh
[2018/01/24, 13:08:16] Luc Hayward: about as portable as waterproof pc
[2018/01/24, 13:09:28] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2018/01/24, 13:10:08] Stuart Mesham: Rip that idea
[2018/01/24, 13:10:37] Stuart Mesham: I was gonna say Chris has 2 monitors lying around on his desk now so you could take one
[2018/01/24, 13:10:50] Stuart Mesham: *commandeer one
[2018/01/24, 13:33:14] Luc Hayward: Ah
[2018/01/24, 13:33:20] Luc Hayward: Would also need mouse and keybpard
[2018/01/24, 13:33:22] Luc Hayward: well keyboard
[2018/01/24, 13:33:29] Luc Hayward: could bring my own stuff I suppose
[2018/01/24, 13:36:21] Stuart Mesham: Nah I'm gonna bring wireless keyboard and mouse so there'll be an extra
[2018/01/24, 13:37:22] Stuart Mesham: I think all you'd need to bring is the actual PC
[2018/01/24, 13:37:45] Stuart Mesham: Though I get how that's still a mission
[2018/01/24, 13:38:31] Stuart Mesham: But I think Mac planetary might be more of a mission 😄
[2018/01/24, 13:41:16] Luc Hayward: Shall i? that's why I was asking chris so I knew if he had power cables already there fore me
[2018/01/24, 13:42:05] Stuart Mesham: Oh I don't think he'll have power cables unless PS4 has the same as PC
[2018/01/24, 13:44:50] Luc Hayward: Not usual;ly
[2018/01/24, 13:44:56] Luc Hayward: hmm could bring my stuff
[2018/01/24, 13:45:04] Luc Hayward: has he got a monitor with cables?
[2018/01/24, 13:47:15] Stuart Mesham: He's probably got another hdmi from the PS4 but just bring one anyway
[2018/01/24, 13:48:11] Stuart Mesham: Just in case he's been swapping one hdmi between them for all these years
[2018/01/24, 13:48:26] Luc Hayward: yeah
[2018/01/24, 13:48:29] Luc Hayward: what time are you headed through
[2018/01/24, 13:48:48] Stuart Mesham: Whenever you are, really 😄
[2018/01/24, 13:48:59] Stuart Mesham: Are you doing nothing at the moment?
[2018/01/24, 13:50:32] Stuart Mesham: Also do you have a one-to-many plug adapter thing? We might need one 😂
[2018/01/24, 13:51:07] Luc Hayward: playing fortnight so yeah doing stuff all
[2018/01/24, 13:51:11] Stuart Mesham: I've only got ones that have really long cords
[2018/01/24, 13:51:12] Luc Hayward: I can try find one
[2018/01/24, 13:51:30] Luc Hayward: No idea where
[2018/01/24, 13:51:45] Luc Hayward: Can bring my power cable which had three plugs on it alreadu
[2018/01/24, 13:52:04] Stuart Mesham: Sounds good
[2018/01/24, 13:52:42] Luc Hayward: What snack you brininging?
[2018/01/24, 13:52:49] Luc Hayward: I'm thinking some chips and some chocolate
[2018/01/24, 13:53:07] Stuart Mesham: Haven't decided 🤦🏻‍♂
[2018/01/24, 13:53:12] Stuart Mesham: Yeah safe bet
[2018/01/24, 13:53:15] Stuart Mesham: Except the chips
[2018/01/24, 13:53:31] Stuart Mesham: He may not even eat chips anymore
[2018/01/24, 13:53:50] Stuart Mesham: I think he's avoiding stuff with "saturated fats"
[2018/01/24, 13:54:36] Luc Hayward: Really? Well we need to eat chips
[2018/01/24, 13:56:18] Stuart Mesham: Yeah we can eat them without him 👍🏻😄
[2018/01/24, 14:01:24] Luc Hayward: Awesome
[2018/01/24, 14:04:17] Luc Hayward: Will tell you when I leave but leaving in 15 min
[2018/01/24, 14:04:27] Luc Hayward: Get to Chris like 3?
[2018/01/24, 14:04:41] Luc Hayward: Or too early?
[2018/01/24, 14:23:42] Stuart Mesham: Woah
[2018/01/24, 14:23:47] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2018/01/24, 14:24:01] Stuart Mesham: If he's cool with that then I'll also try be there by 3
[2018/01/24, 14:27:32] Luc Hayward: Why a table
[2018/01/24, 14:27:55] Stuart Mesham: The 4k TV reks your eyes at the bin
[2018/01/24, 14:28:06] Stuart Mesham: Trust me, I tried it a lot
[2018/01/24, 14:29:41] Luc Hayward: Ok
[2018/01/24, 14:30:10] Luc Hayward: Leaving now, gonna grab some snack then head to chris
[2018/01/24, 14:33:24] Stuart Mesham: Ok

[2018/01/26, 13:32:07] Stuart Mesham: Can you have a quick look at my registration form thingy? I'm just gonna not register for INF and hope for the best with the concession stuff
[2018/01/26, 13:32:14] Stuart Mesham: I emailed it to you
[2018/01/26, 13:41:34] Luc Hayward: Yeah will look

[2018/01/27, 08:19:28] Luc Hayward: You needed to complete the 2019 column
[2018/01/27, 12:03:08] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2018/01/27, 12:03:14] Stuart Mesham: Damn
[2018/01/27, 12:08:06] Stuart Mesham: Dunno what the point of the 2019 column was but I'll see if I can resubmit
[2018/01/27, 12:16:58] Luc Hayward: They'll probably make you resubmit
[2018/01/27, 12:17:14] Luc Hayward: It shows that you have a plan for third year that won't blatantly fuck you over
[2018/01/27, 12:18:08] Stuart Mesham: Hm
[2018/01/27, 12:32:31] Luc Hayward: Like that you aren't going to be taking 5 different courses in third year and that it follows on logically
[2018/01/27, 12:33:08] Stuart Mesham: Oh dear you can't resubmit from PeopleSoft
[2018/01/27, 12:33:19] Stuart Mesham: I've emailed the registration support people

[2018/01/28, 15:59:56] Stuart Mesham: I saw something recently about NVIDIA backing this new company that was trying to do this but with cameras on the trolleys/baskets

[2018/01/31, 13:06:55] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/01/31, 13:07:08] Stuart Mesham: I'm actually considering
[2018/01/31, 13:07:47] Luc Hayward: Lots of work though during Te
[2018/01/31, 13:07:49] Luc Hayward: Term
[2018/01/31, 13:08:21] Stuart Mesham: Well if I'm not doing the INF course... 😄
[2018/01/31, 13:09:13] Luc Hayward: That's true....You still need to find out what you're going to do though to make up for it if you have to
[2018/01/31, 13:09:34] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/01/31, 13:10:34] Stuart Mesham: Dan's friend who I talked to said they gave him "compensation work" but told him to just do it in his own time and that it wouldn't be marked so he just didn't do it
[2018/01/31, 13:10:56] Stuart Mesham: Now he has a Bsc in physics and computer science 😂
[2018/01/31, 13:11:00] Luc Hayward: ?? Weird. If it's not marked why is it given. 😂
[2018/01/31, 13:11:16] Stuart Mesham: They trusted him too much 😄
[2018/01/31, 13:11:33] Luc Hayward: Maybe they trust you too 😂

[2018/01/31, 18:24:14] Luc Hayward: Kk
[2018/01/31, 18:42:07] Luc Hayward: Gimme a shout on here if I don't answer/before you call
[2018/01/31, 19:02:34] Stuart Mesham: Sure
[2018/01/31, 20:26:42] Luc Hayward: Ready?
[2018/01/31, 20:26:45] Stuart Mesham: 5 minutes?
[2018/01/31, 20:26:51] Luc Hayward: Sounds good
[2018/01/31, 20:26:50] Stuart Mesham: Oh hi
[2018/01/31, 20:26:54] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/01/31, 20:31:29] Stuart Mesham: Get on hangouts!
[2018/01/31, 20:59:38] Luc Hayward: https://github.com/sbrodehl/HashCode
[2018/01/31, 21:14:00] Stuart Mesham: You still here?
[2018/02/01, 11:24:55] Stuart Mesham: Did you see that UVa asks you to run a cryptocurrency miner in your browser instead of showing ads?
[2018/02/01, 11:25:17] Luc Hayward: Now😂
[2018/02/01, 11:25:30] Luc Hayward: Nope
[2018/02/01, 11:25:35] Stuart Mesham: No I was just thinking about it now 😂
[2018/02/01, 11:25:48] Luc Hayward: Probably massively more profitable
[2018/02/01, 11:25:56] Stuart Mesham: I said no though 😄
[2018/02/01, 11:26:05] Luc Hayward: If you mine some little alt con that can be run on a CPU
[2018/02/01, 11:26:08] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/02/01, 11:26:49] Luc Hayward: Are you talking about something different to them asking to use your PC for computation power? I think that's for actually running people's code
[2018/02/01, 11:27:06] Stuart Mesham: I'm fairly sure it was a miner
[2018/02/01, 11:27:10] Stuart Mesham: I'll check 😄
[2018/02/01, 11:29:20] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2018/02/01, 11:30:15] Luc Hayward: Did you see we were added to the CS2 mailing list
[2018/02/01, 11:30:27] Luc Hayward: oh yeah wow
[2018/02/01, 11:30:38] Stuart Mesham: You got an email?
[2018/02/01, 11:30:54] Stuart Mesham: I don't think I was added
[2018/02/01, 11:31:00] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/02/01, 11:31:27] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I didn't get that
[2018/02/01, 11:32:54] Luc Hayward: oh rip
[2018/02/01, 11:39:51] Luc Hayward: Thats so strange
[2018/02/01, 11:40:26] Stuart Mesham: Maybe they send that as soon as they sign you up
[2018/02/01, 11:40:39] Luc Hayward: oh maybe your registration didnt go through
[2018/02/01, 11:40:46] Stuart Mesham: Yes
[2018/02/01, 11:41:35] Stuart Mesham: Probably that
[2018/02/01, 11:41:45] Stuart Mesham: Has Keegan got it?
[2018/02/01, 11:43:32] Luc Hayward: didnt ask
[2018/02/01, 12:46:22] Stuart Mesham: Ah

[2018/02/04, 10:35:30] Stuart Mesham: I'll tentatively say 11:40
[2018/02/04, 10:35:48] Stuart Mesham: I'll probably be ready by then
[2018/02/04, 10:40:25] Luc Hayward: Ok

[2018/02/04, 19:41:00] Luc Hayward: Hey man thanks so much for yesterday and today👌🏼 was super cool to get back to doing with together and practice collaborating with git, I think it actually works really well once we got used to it🤞🏻. Makes for much better collaborating work and forces you to write cleaner😂🤷🏻‍♂️
[2018/02/04, 19:51:06] Stuart Mesham: Thanks for coming! Yeah I think we did get kinda good at it 😂 _and_ it was fun 😄
[2018/02/04, 19:51:24] Luc Hayward: Will be fun to work on more stuff in the future
[2018/02/04, 19:51:57] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 👌🏻
[2018/02/04, 19:52:22] Stuart Mesham: Now that we're pro git-ers we can
[2018/02/04, 20:50:56] Luc Hayward: Exactly

[2018/02/05, 18:41:12] Stuart Mesham: Who was the original actor?
[2018/02/05, 18:41:24] Luc Hayward: No clue but its good right?
[2018/02/05, 18:41:27] Stuart Mesham: That was good 👌🏻
[2018/02/05, 18:41:32] Luc Hayward: just be careful how you research it
[2018/02/05, 18:41:42] Stuart Mesham: Yeah wow
[2018/02/05, 18:41:57] Stuart Mesham: Risky Google
[2018/02/05, 18:41:58] Luc Hayward: It's porn for the vast majority of stuff being made but there is a sfw subreddit
[2018/02/05, 18:42:11] Luc Hayward: google deepfakessfw
[2018/02/05, 18:42:23] Luc Hayward: no
[2018/02/05, 18:42:23] Luc Hayward: no
[2018/02/05, 18:42:25] Luc Hayward: dont do that
[2018/02/05, 18:42:34] Stuart Mesham: Didn't work? 😂
[2018/02/05, 18:42:42] Luc Hayward: https://www.reddit.com/r/SFWDeepFakes
[2018/02/05, 18:42:47] Luc Hayward: That one should be safe
[2018/02/05, 18:56:00] Stuart Mesham: It's all Nic Cage 🙈
[2018/02/05, 18:56:11] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2018/02/06, 21:41:57] Luc Hayward: You get your cs account details?
[2018/02/06, 21:42:20] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/02/06, 21:42:35] Luc Hayward: Changed password?
[2018/02/06, 21:43:19] Stuart Mesham: It's just a separate username and password
[2018/02/06, 21:43:41] Luc Hayward: Nah username is still mshstu001
[2018/02/06, 21:43:45] Luc Hayward: Just a new password
[2018/02/06, 21:43:52] Stuart Mesham: We still use our old UCT username password for everything else though
[2018/02/06, 21:43:56] Luc Hayward: Was asking if you changed t from the random string of charactets
[2018/02/06, 21:44:20] Luc Hayward: Yeah it's just for cs stuff like accessing servers and shit
[2018/02/06, 21:44:24] Stuart Mesham: Nah I'm just leaving it
[2018/02/06, 21:44:52] Stuart Mesham: I'll use their default password
[2018/02/06, 21:45:08] Luc Hayward: You're gonna use the default??? Every time you have to login??
[2018/02/06, 21:45:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I'll get used to it eventually 😂
[2018/02/06, 21:46:20] Luc Hayward: Doubtful...Just change it. There's an online tool no need to SSH in (also tried to SSH in but the server doesn't recognise the command they say to use)
[2018/02/06, 21:46:48] Stuart Mesham: Nah it's more secure than 123 😄
[2018/02/06, 21:47:08] Luc Hayward: I just made it like my regular uct one
[2018/02/06, 21:47:47] Stuart Mesham: So now I know... 🤔😄
[2018/02/06, 21:48:09] Luc Hayward: Do you know my uct one😂I'd be impressed....
[2018/02/06, 21:49:04] Stuart Mesham: No but one day you'll accidentally type it into the username thing while I'm there
[2018/02/06, 21:49:10] Stuart Mesham: And I'll see all of it
[2018/02/06, 21:49:19] Stuart Mesham: It's just waiting to happen
[2018/02/06, 21:53:37] Luc Hayward: Ah the evil plan
[2018/02/06, 21:57:40] Stuart Mesham: That's right
[2018/02/07, 07:45:17] Luc Hayward: https://www.pcgamer.com/age-of-empires-stands-the-test-of-time/
[2018/02/07, 10:23:49] Stuart Mesham: It's back
[2018/02/07, 10:24:18] Stuart Mesham: Though I've never actually played the original
[2018/02/07, 10:24:24] Stuart Mesham: Only the sequel
[2018/02/07, 11:07:58] Luc Hayward: Ah I had that big sexual box set of 4
[2018/02/07, 11:08:06] Luc Hayward: Sequel!!!
[2018/02/07, 11:10:15] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2018/02/07, 11:10:41] Stuart Mesham: Could take that quite far out of context 😂
[2018/02/07, 11:10:50] Luc Hayward: Yeah.....
[2018/02/07, 18:57:49] Luc Hayward: https://youtu.be/EMOj1HSpYlk
[2018/02/07, 19:10:04] Stuart Mesham: Soz to busy having a little planetary sesh
[2018/02/07, 19:11:17] Luc Hayward: I should get planetary so we can play
[2018/02/07, 19:11:52] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/02/07, 19:12:26] Stuart Mesham: Or we can have a direct one but my internet is slow 😄
[2018/02/07, 19:19:56] Luc Hayward: ? What you mean
[2018/02/07, 19:22:26] Stuart Mesham: Remember that mod that let's you connect my typing in the IP?
[2018/02/07, 19:37:27] Luc Hayward: Oh yeah I do
[2018/02/07, 19:37:32] Luc Hayward: Meh rather just buy it
[2018/02/07, 20:30:08] Stuart Mesham: Yeah they deserve it
[2018/02/07, 20:37:53] Luc Hayward: https://www.google.co.za/amp/s/atomicsupermen.wordpress.com/2017/11/28/the-good-doctor-microsoft-hololens-surgery-rehearsal/amp/
[2018/02/07, 20:57:45] Stuart Mesham: Hm that's cool
[2018/02/07, 21:00:44] Luc Hayward: Unrealistic but a good way to excite people about technology
[2018/02/07, 21:02:03] Stuart Mesham: I mean maybe one day they'll actually use it for practice like that
[2018/02/07, 21:02:20] Stuart Mesham: Probably still a good few years away though
[2018/02/07, 21:02:28] Stuart Mesham: Or many
[2018/02/07, 21:02:43] Luc Hayward: Nah
[2018/02/07, 21:02:49] Luc Hayward: The idea is already there
[2018/02/07, 21:03:33] Luc Hayward: Doctors from further away can watch in and direct using hear mounted displays
[2018/02/07, 21:04:14] Luc Hayward: Residents can have a first person view of surgery procedures
[2018/02/07, 21:28:48] Stuart Mesham: Aaaahh 😨😂
[2018/02/07, 21:29:06] Stuart Mesham: I wouldn't want to watch
[2018/02/07, 21:29:24] Luc Hayward: I would!!!!
[2018/02/07, 21:29:33] Luc Hayward: I'm still trying to get into dissections
[2018/02/07, 21:30:45] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2018/02/07, 21:30:56] Stuart Mesham: Ok maybe for like 1 minute out of curiosity
[2018/02/07, 21:31:02] Luc Hayward: No
[2018/02/07, 21:31:03] Stuart Mesham: Then I'd probably pass out
[2018/02/07, 21:31:05] Luc Hayward: Everything
[2018/02/07, 21:31:19] Stuart Mesham: Oh no no no no 😂
[2018/02/07, 21:31:26] Luc Hayward: Yessss
[2018/02/07, 21:32:19] Stuart Mesham: Ok you could watch and I would just let you watch and be happy for you and not watch 😂
[2018/02/07, 21:32:25] Luc Hayward: Yes!
[2018/02/07, 21:33:06] Stuart Mesham: Eugh I wonder if there are human dissection videos on YouTube
[2018/02/07, 21:33:17] Luc Hayward: Meh wanna actually be there
[2018/02/07, 21:33:24] Stuart Mesham: I am going to search that at some point now that I've had that thought
[2018/02/07, 21:33:32] Stuart Mesham: 😂
[2018/02/07, 21:51:58] Luc Hayward: We're you playing with Chris or online?
[2018/02/07, 22:02:55] Stuart Mesham: Nah online and now ai

[2018/02/07, 22:05:32] Luc Hayward: Ah right suuure
[2018/02/07, 22:05:54] Stuart Mesham: You don't believe? 😂
[2018/02/07, 22:07:06] Stuart Mesham: They did all decide to start on the same moon and then I ended up with a massive earth planet to myself so I may have had more metal than all of them put together
[2018/02/07, 22:07:19] Luc Hayward: Nah I believe im just messing with you
[2018/02/07, 22:07:35] Luc Hayward: 😂😂😂

[2018/02/07, 22:08:15] Luc Hayward: Yep you should be 👍👍
[2018/02/07, 22:08:23] Stuart Mesham: Gonna try another one and see what happens if they don't do that

[2018/02/08, 16:19:03] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/02/08, 16:19:41] Luc Hayward: Its a private chat room 😂

[2018/02/08, 16:20:46] Stuart Mesham: Did you get to the chat room?
[2018/02/08, 16:20:50] Luc Hayward: Swinging through again this weekend?
[2018/02/08, 16:20:55] Luc Hayward: Nah not yet 😂
[2018/02/08, 16:21:03] Stuart Mesham: Yeah 👍🏻
[2018/02/08, 16:21:18] Luc Hayward: Me to you again👍?
[2018/02/08, 16:21:36] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/02/08, 16:21:50] Stuart Mesham: Wait actually do you have a less sunny big desk? 😂
[2018/02/08, 16:22:04] Stuart Mesham: My eyes get rekt every time
[2018/02/08, 16:22:58] Luc Hayward: Really?😂we can just cover up better? I only have my dining room table because there are curtains in there.
[2018/02/08, 16:23:45] Luc Hayward: Like if we cover those two side windows you'd probably feel better
[2018/02/08, 16:26:00] Stuart Mesham: Yeah I guess we can hang towels over everything
[2018/02/08, 16:27:36] Stuart Mesham: Hey we've got all of our CS lecturers again except Charles
[2018/02/08, 16:27:46] Luc Hayward: ??
[2018/02/08, 16:27:58] Luc Hayward: How do you know
[2018/02/08, 16:28:16] Luc Hayward: Yeah👍👍
[2018/02/08, 16:28:18] Stuart Mesham: You can see in the participants thing
[2018/02/08, 16:28:34] Luc Hayward: Oh right
[2018/02/08, 16:28:35] Stuart Mesham: We've got Hussein as well now
[2018/02/08, 16:28:45] Luc Hayward: Are you looking at 2004z?
[2018/02/08, 16:28:50] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/02/08, 16:29:25] Luc Hayward: I wonder why they're all on there though because there's no lectures or anything for that
[2018/02/08, 16:31:25] Stuart Mesham: I think it's so they can add announcements
[2018/02/08, 16:39:23] Stuart Mesham: My MCB2020F is up

[2018/02/10, 15:02:02] Stuart Mesham: It's basically just there because the motherboard didn't have an HDMI
[2018/02/10, 15:02:25] Luc Hayward: worth 600 bucks
[2018/02/10, 15:02:34] Stuart Mesham: Yeah

[2018/02/10, 17:06:46] Stuart Mesham: Just started like 5 minutes ago
[2018/02/10, 17:18:13] Luc Hayward: right
[2018/02/10, 17:19:18] Stuart Mesham: I got distracted looking up graphics cards
[2018/02/10, 17:19:32] Stuart Mesham: Guess how much you can spend on one card?
[2018/02/10, 17:22:50] Stuart Mesham: I'm not sure why this one in particular is so much more expensive than all the others but according to pricecheck you can spend R43049 on one card
[2018/02/10, 17:24:55] Luc Hayward: not intended for gaming
[2018/02/10, 17:24:59] Luc Hayward: is it this one
[2018/02/10, 17:25:38] Luc Hayward: Is it the Titan V?

[2018/02/10, 17:30:36] Stuart Mesham: Still quite hectic 😄
[2018/02/10, 17:30:52] Luc Hayward: look at the titan V
[2018/02/10, 17:31:03] Luc Hayward: it's not intended for gaming (but you still can)

[2018/02/11, 09:21:42] Stuart Mesham: Getting in the shower now, I don't think there's anyone to let you in so you might be stuck outside for a bit if you arrive now, sorry 🙈

[2018/02/20, 18:35:39] Luc Hayward: I found one about Bruce lee
[2018/02/20, 18:35:59] Luc Hayward: The reason that notepad seemed to do weird things is because I think it doesn't edit in place?
[2018/02/20, 18:36:33] Stuart Mesham: ?? 😂
[2018/02/20, 18:37:05] Stuart Mesham: Oh?
[2018/02/20, 18:43:27] Luc Hayward: I dno I read something about how some programs create a new file rather than editing the existing file in place? Sorry if like sorting a list by placing the elements in order somewhere else and overwriting the original?
[2018/02/20, 18:44:18] Stuart Mesham: Ah makes sense
[2018/02/20, 18:45:38] Stuart Mesham: So each time you save on Preview it's technically a new file at a different location on the hard drive
[2018/02/20, 18:45:45] Stuart Mesham: *textedit
[2018/02/20, 19:01:29] Luc Hayward: I think?

[2018/02/23, 16:25:03] Stuart Mesham: So pretty good
[2018/02/23, 16:25:07] Luc Hayward: Really? No lectures?
[2018/02/23, 16:25:17] Stuart Mesham: No lectures
[2018/02/23, 16:25:24] Luc Hayward: Nice!
[2018/02/23, 16:25:36] Luc Hayward: But you'd usually have a practical right?
[2018/02/23, 16:25:36] Stuart Mesham: There was an online test that I thought we had to be there for too
[2018/02/23, 16:25:43] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/02/23, 16:25:49] Luc Hayward: Nothing for comp sci though?
[2018/02/23, 16:25:56] Stuart Mesham: Nope

[2018/02/23, 16:26:34] Luc Hayward: Oh
[2018/02/23, 16:27:03] Luc Hayward: Only had comp sci yesterday because Tut's only start next week (normally I have two Tut's on a Wednesday and comp sci practice with you)
[2018/02/23, 16:27:44] Stuart Mesham: So it just wasn't worth it to drive in for comp sci? 😂
[2018/02/23, 16:28:01] Luc Hayward: Yeah all that time in traffic and all that petrol would be silly
[2018/02/23, 16:28:29] Stuart Mesham: I thought you were sick or something 🙈😂
[2018/02/23, 16:28:50] Luc Hayward: Will be back on Monday don't worry🎉🎂

[2018/02/23, 16:31:40] Luc Hayward: Just to ask if he was still joining us
[2018/02/23, 16:32:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah he's an organised person though, he probably has it in his calendar 👍🏻
[2018/02/23, 16:32:53] Luc Hayward: Yep😂 no just meant you never know if something comes up with work
[2018/02/23, 16:33:32] Stuart Mesham: Yeah his boss might decide to flee the country and take the crew with him
[2018/02/23, 16:33:34] Luc Hayward: You feel like you're managing to learn your Unix commands off by heart?
[2018/02/23, 16:33:39] Luc Hayward: Exactly
[2018/02/23, 16:33:46] Luc Hayward: Or just a giant party

[2018/02/23, 16:44:04] Stuart Mesham: Thanks
[2018/02/23, 16:49:39] Luc Hayward: I assume it will just be showing the tutor we can move directories, make folders and files, copy, create links, do a simple search and or sort on files. And like one piping question
[2018/02/23, 17:11:37] Stuart Mesham: Yeah it'll be simpler than most of the lecture stuff
[2018/02/23, 17:17:13] Luc Hayward: I'm sure

[2018/02/24, 14:35:05] Luc Hayward: Go to the apple icon then about this Mac and it should give you your serial number
[2018/02/24, 14:51:57] Stuart Mesham: I think my laptop is about to blue screen 🙈
[2018/02/24, 14:52:28] Stuart Mesham: Radius is 1300 😣
[2018/02/24, 14:53:03] Luc Hayward: Oh wow
[2018/02/24, 14:53:17] Luc Hayward: Is it responding?
[2018/02/24, 14:53:23] Stuart Mesham: The beast got so rekt
[2018/02/24, 14:53:32] Stuart Mesham: I can hear ringing 😂
[2018/02/24, 14:53:53] Luc Hayward: Are you able to use the pc? Do we wait?
[2018/02/24, 14:53:54] Stuart Mesham: Ok windows is working but planetary is frozen
[2018/02/24, 14:54:08] Stuart Mesham: Wow it unfroze
[2018/02/24, 14:54:10] Luc Hayward: You're in
[2018/02/24, 14:54:57] Stuart Mesham: Ok tell them to start the game but I probably won't be able to run it
[2018/02/24, 14:55:06] Luc Hayward: Kicked you
[2018/02/24, 14:55:11] Luc Hayward: You're gone on voice
[2018/02/24, 14:55:16] Stuart Mesham: Ah fair enough
[2018/02/24, 14:55:38] Luc Hayward: I left
[2018/02/24, 14:55:59] Stuart Mesham: Ok I'll wait for my planetary to calm down a bit 😄
[2018/02/24, 14:56:09] Stuart Mesham: It's on returning to main menu
[2018/02/24, 14:56:23] Stuart Mesham: Ok everything's fine now
[2018/02/24, 14:56:27] Luc Hayward: Kk
[2018/02/24, 14:58:00] Stuart Mesham: I could go steal RAM but my Dad is probably busy with the laptop at the moment 🙈
[2018/02/24, 14:58:12] Luc Hayward: Eh it's chilled
[2018/02/24, 15:32:30] Stuart Mesham: Rreeeee

[2018/02/24, 15:39:23] Luc Hayward: AI*
[2018/02/24, 15:39:37] Stuart Mesham: No
[2018/02/24, 15:48:51] Luc Hayward: Died
[2018/02/24, 15:49:16] Stuart Mesham: Nooooo
[2018/02/24, 15:49:23] Stuart Mesham: Should I just quit?
[2018/02/24, 15:49:34] Luc Hayward: Nah can keep going
[2018/02/24, 15:49:39] Luc Hayward: I'm stopping after this one anyway

[2018/02/24, 16:02:31] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2018/02/24, 16:20:20] Stuart Mesham: Check out this review of Ster-Kinekor Blue Route on Google Maps

https://goo.gl/maps/mGFSx9nCzRH2
[2018/02/24, 16:21:37] Stuart Mesham: Are we watching 3d?
[2018/02/24, 16:25:25] Luc Hayward: It's the only one there is
[2018/02/24, 16:25:41] Luc Hayward: No 3d was full
[2018/02/24, 16:26:18] Stuart Mesham: Ok
[2018/02/24, 16:59:50] Luc Hayward: Gonna book so long
[2018/02/24, 17:05:29] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/02/24, 17:06:14] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/02/24, 17:16:04] Stuart Mesham: Green!
[2018/02/24, 17:16:12] Stuart Mesham: Sorry a bit late
[2018/02/24, 17:16:16] Stuart Mesham: I'm here now
[2018/02/24, 17:16:18] Luc Hayward: Ok I'll get green
[2018/02/24, 17:16:40] Stuart Mesham: Are you at the movie place?
[2018/02/24, 17:16:47] Luc Hayward: Dude there all gone
[2018/02/24, 17:17:05] Stuart Mesham: Oh my goodness 😂
[2018/02/24, 17:17:13] Stuart Mesham: Where are you?
[2018/02/24, 17:17:22] Luc Hayward: By the food court
[2018/02/24, 17:17:17] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/02/24, 17:24:53] Luc Hayward: <‎image omitted>
[2018/02/24, 18:19:07] Stuart Mesham: So everything seems to be the same except the speed of the RAM...
[2018/02/24, 18:19:17] Stuart Mesham: I wonder if that's a problem
[2018/02/24, 18:19:19] Luc Hayward: Ah....
[2018/02/24, 18:19:21] Luc Hayward: It can be
[2018/02/24, 18:19:25] Luc Hayward: Faster or slower?
[2018/02/24, 18:19:31] Stuart Mesham: Slower
[2018/02/24, 18:19:39] Luc Hayward: Oh rip
[2018/02/24, 18:19:42] Luc Hayward: What's yours
[2018/02/24, 18:19:43] Stuart Mesham: 1600 and 1333
[2018/02/24, 18:19:48] Stuart Mesham: 1600
[2018/02/24, 18:20:39] Stuart Mesham: I'm to just turn it on and see if it works 🤔
[2018/02/24, 18:20:53] Luc Hayward: No
[2018/02/24, 18:20:55] Luc Hayward: Dont
[2018/02/24, 18:20:59] Stuart Mesham: Do you think it can break stuff?
[2018/02/24, 18:21:02] Luc Hayward: You won't break anythimg
[2018/02/24, 18:21:17] Luc Hayward: But when you turn it on you need to boot to bios
[2018/02/24, 18:21:23] Luc Hayward: So mine is 1333?
[2018/02/24, 18:21:26] Stuart Mesham: Yeah
[2018/02/24, 18:21:33] Luc Hayward: You need all your ram at the same speed
[2018/02/24, 18:21:38] Luc Hayward: Generally
[2018/02/24, 18:21:51] Luc Hayward: So you'd need to boot to BIOS and then set both sticks to the same speed
[2018/02/24, 18:21:59] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2018/02/24, 18:22:03] Luc Hayward: And you'd more than likely have to drop them to the lower speed
[2018/02/24, 18:22:30] Stuart Mesham: Think it's worth it?
[2018/02/24, 18:22:39] Luc Hayward: Try?🤷🏻‍♂️👍🏼
[2018/02/24, 18:22:52] Luc Hayward: You won't brick anything, might just refuse to boot at worst
[2018/02/24, 18:23:09] Stuart Mesham: Ah
[2018/02/24, 18:23:17] Stuart Mesham: I'll try
[2018/02/24, 18:36:18] Luc Hayward: Keep me posted 👌🏼
[2018/02/24, 18:37:50] Stuart Mesham: I'm guessing this means I have to change bus speed? (They seem to say online that RAM frequency must be double bus frequency because RAM is Double Data Rate)
[2018/02/24, 18:40:45] Stuart Mesham: Plugging it in now, hope it doesn't explode
[2018/02/24, 18:42:42] Stuart Mesham: I just booted it up now and it seems to have changed it automatically
[2018/02/24, 18:43:22] Stuart Mesham: Unless it was 1333 before 🤷🏻‍♂
[2018/02/24, 18:43:29] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2018/02/24, 18:45:54] Stuart Mesham: Woah it seems to have just booted up without issues
[2018/02/24, 18:45:58] Stuart Mesham: ¯\_(ツ)_/ ¯
[2018/02/24, 18:48:31] Stuart Mesham: Maybe my laptop will just spontaneously catch fire one day while playing planetary, but until then, thanks 😂
[2018/02/24, 18:49:31] Stuart Mesham: <‎image omitted>
[2018/02/24, 18:49:33] Stuart Mesham: Oh wait
[2018/02/24, 18:49:39] Stuart Mesham: It just happened
[2018/02/24, 18:49:44] Stuart Mesham: It bluescreened
[2018/02/24, 18:55:03] Stuart Mesham: Now steam says I haven't installed planetary!
[2018/02/24, 18:58:58] Stuart Mesham: I launched stick fight and it worked
[2018/02/24, 19:31:25] Stuart Mesham: Planetary just launched!
[2018/02/24, 19:32:01] Luc Hayward: ?? So...
[2018/02/24, 19:32:32] Stuart Mesham: I dunno why it bluescreened the first time
[2018/02/24, 19:32:42] Luc Hayward: No clue. Working now?
[2018/02/24, 19:32:52] Stuart Mesham: Seems to be working perfectly
[2018/02/24, 19:33:11] Stuart Mesham: Gonna try launch an ai skirmish with a big system just to be sure
[2018/02/24, 19:33:21] Luc Hayward: Yeah try that
[2018/02/24, 19:33:39] Luc Hayward: Or just run a benchmark
[2018/02/24, 19:38:33] Stuart Mesham: Nah it launched the big system
[2018/02/24, 19:38:39] Stuart Mesham: ez
[2018/02/24, 19:42:06] Luc Hayward: You're welcome 😂😂
[2018/02/24, 19:42:32] Stuart Mesham: Thank you so much it's working beautifully 😂
[2018/02/24, 19:43:01] Stuart Mesham: I mean if you want it back at some point just tell me 😂
[2018/02/24, 19:43:32] Luc Hayward: Nash I have no use for it, nothing in that laptop now that's with it.
[2018/02/24, 19:48:24] Stuart Mesham: Ah I see
[2018/02/24, 19:48:35] Luc Hayward: It's got WiFi
[2018/02/24, 19:48:37] Luc Hayward: Keyboard
[2018/02/24, 19:48:44] Luc Hayward: Track pad
[2018/02/24, 19:48:47] Luc Hayward: Screen
[2018/02/24, 19:48:51] Luc Hayward: Cpu
[2018/02/24, 19:48:55] Luc Hayward: Disk drive
[2018/02/24, 19:49:05] Stuart Mesham: The beast also had a "it's got WiFi" sticker 😄
[2018/02/24, 19:49:22] Luc Hayward: No like that's all that's still in it
[2018/02/24, 19:49:29] Stuart Mesham: What doesn't it have? 😄
[2018/02/24, 19:49:38] Luc Hayward: Harddrive
[2018/02/24, 19:49:41] Stuart Mesham: No graphics card?
[2018/02/24, 19:49:50] Luc Hayward: Both Ram sticks
[2018/02/24, 19:49:50] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2018/02/24, 19:49:57] Luc Hayward: Battery
[2018/02/24, 19:50:01] Luc Hayward: Charger
[2018/02/24, 19:50:05] Stuart Mesham: What happened to the other RAM stick?
[2018/02/24, 19:50:10] Luc Hayward: Dno
[2018/02/24, 19:50:16] Luc Hayward: Salvaged it
[2018/02/24, 19:50:23] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2018/02/24, 19:50:29] Luc Hayward: No sure why
[2018/02/24, 19:50:37] Stuart Mesham: Even the battery is gone? 😂
[2018/02/24, 19:50:48] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2018/02/24, 19:50:51] Stuart Mesham: Wow that laptop really got eaten
[2018/02/24, 19:51:02] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2018/02/24, 19:51:07] Stuart Mesham: Had it's internals torn out
[2018/02/24, 19:51:10] Stuart Mesham: Shame
[2018/02/24, 19:51:47] Luc Hayward: It's been take apart entirely and put back together too. Like everything disassembled and puy back
[2018/02/24, 19:52:01] Stuart Mesham: Oh
[2018/02/24, 19:52:26] Stuart Mesham: Does it still have the fingerprint scanner?
[2018/02/24, 19:52:56] Luc Hayward: Yeah
[2018/02/24, 19:53:02] Luc Hayward: It's on there
[2018/02/24, 19:53:20] Stuart Mesham: See if it will work with your desktop
[2018/02/24, 19:53:27] Luc Hayward: It might
[2018/02/24, 19:53:27] Stuart Mesham: That would be awesome 😂
[2018/02/24, 19:53:38] Stuart Mesham: Log in like James Bond
[2018/02/24, 19:54:15] Luc Hayward: No idea how it attaches, night be soldered into mobile. Also needs driver's and software.
[2018/02/24, 19:58:00] Stuart Mesham: True
[2018/02/24, 19:59:03] Stuart Mesham: I'm a little bored so I'm probably gonna play some planetary now if you want to join (but no pressure)
[2018/02/24, 19:59:48] Luc Hayward: Nash watching TV with my mom👌🏼
[2018/02/24, 20:00:06] Stuart Mesham: Ok cool
